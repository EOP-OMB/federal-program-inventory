- description: Funding was made available to assist local 501(c)(3) status organizations
    and groups to undertake local AMD reclamation projects to improve the water quality
    of streams impacted by acid mine drainage. The funding priorities and technical
    focus are to restore streams affected by AMD to a level that will support a diverse
    biological community and provide recreational opportunities for the public. Non-Federal
    entities used WCAP funds for AMD problems related to SMCRA defined abandoned coal
    mining activities and processes, which include remediation of AMD, sources of
    AMD, and installation of passive or active water treatment systems, including
    repairs and renovations. Projects may also include reclamation of lands that are
    contributing sediment or acid forming materials to streams.

- description: 'Pathfinders Resource Conservation and Development, Inc., a nonprofit
    organization dedicated to strengthening local economies and encouraging natural
    resource conservation, was awarded $400,000 for four AMD projects selected through
    a competitive merit review process. WCAP grants result in partnerships that encourage
    long-term commitment to projects through engagement with local communities and
    environmental conservation.


    “Pathfinders RC&D looks forward to working with OSMRE to continue to improve Iowa’s
    water quality by removing the health and safety hazards often associated with
    abandoned mine lands,” said Ashley Utt, Pathfinders RC&D executive director. “Approximately
    1700 acres across south central Iowa have been reclaimed through the partnership
    between Pathfinders,


    OSMRE, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, and the County
    Soil & Water Conservation Districts of Iowa.”


    The following watershed projects will each receive $100,000 from this round of
    WCAP grants for abating hazardous abandoned mine features and then clearing, re-grading,
    and re-vegetating the site: Woodruff North (120 acres), VAN EE (80 acres), and
    Johnson (10 acres), all near Bussey in Marion County; and Barnett (16 acres) near
    Knoxville in Marion County.


    About the WCAP Program

    WCAP grants are typically around $100,000 per project to complete local acid mine
    drainage reclamation projects. Projects can include installation of passive or
    active water treatment systems, as well as reclamation of lands that contribute
    sediment or acid forming materials to streams. AMD projects are selected through
    a merit review process. WCAP grants result in partnerships that encourage long-term
    commitment to projects through engagement with local communities and environmental
    conservation.'
