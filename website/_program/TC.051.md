objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be
  taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 20 percent (plus the 3.8
  percent surtax). Certain agricultural income, such as unharvested crops, qualify
  for taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income, and so benefit from the
  preferentially low 20 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains (plus the 3.8 percent
  surtax).
