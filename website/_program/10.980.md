objective: ELRP 2022 provides direct financial assistance to livestock producers for
  losses incurred because of qualifying drought or wildfire in calendar year 2022.
  ELRP 2022 will provide assistance to eligible livestock producers who faced increased
  supplemental feed costs resulting from forage losses. ELRP 2022 was authorized by
  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Division N, Title I, Pub. L. 117-328)
  and will provide payments to eligible livestock producers using data already submitted
  to FSA on 2022 Livestock Disaster Program (LFP) Application, CCC-853. Although payments
  made under LFP do not have a direct correlation to the increased feed costs incurred,
  to deliver this assistance quickly, FSA is using certain LFP data and issuing an
  ELRP 2022 payment as a percentage of the gross payment calculated through LFP as
  a proxy for these increased supplemental feed costs to eliminate the requirement
  for producers to resubmit information for ELRP 2022. No action is required for eligible
  producers to receive ELRP 2022 payments. The ELRP 2022 payment will be equal to
  the eligible livestock producerâ€™s gross 2022 LFP-calculated payment multiplied by
  the applicable ELRP payment percentage. The ELRP 2022 payment percentage will be
  90 percent for historically underserved farmers and ranchers and 75 percent for
  all other producers. To stay within the available funding, ELRP 2022 payments for
  increased supplemental feed costs in 2022 will be factored initially by 25 percent.
  If funds remain available after initial payments, an additional payment percent
  may be issued.
