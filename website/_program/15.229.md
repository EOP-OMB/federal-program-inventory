objective: 'The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages and protects wild horses and
  burros on 26.9 million acres of public lands across ten western states as part of
  its mission to administer public lands for multiple uses. The Wild Horse and Burro
  Program''s goal is to manage healthy wild horses and burros on healthy public rangelands.
  The BLM created the Wild Horse and Burro Program to implement the Wild-Free Roaming
  Horses and Burros Act, passed by Congress in 1971. Broadly, the law declares wild
  horses and burros to be “living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the
  West” and stipulates that the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service have the responsibility
  to manage and protect herds in their respective jurisdictions within areas where
  wild horses and burros were found roaming in 1971. The Wild Horse and Burro Program
  consists of two main branches: (1) On-Range management of wild horses and burros,
  and (2) Off-Range management and care of wild horses and burros. The goal of the
  On-Range program is to manage for healthy wild horse and burro populations and to
  maintain a thriving natural ecological balance with other resources and land uses.
  The Off-Range management goal is to ensure the health and welfare of wild horses
  and burros that were removed from public lands under BLM care, to place animals
  into private care through adoptions, sales, and transfers, to conduct compliance
  inspections of adopted animals and to build partnerships and relationships with
  external organizations. Communications, outreach, and education are priorities of
  both branches. This program continues to advance the Department of Interior''s priorities
  to address the climate crisis and restore balance on public lands and waters.'

- description: No current data available. The BLM currently manages approximately
    58,000 horses and burros in 179 herd management areas in 10 western states. Nationally,
    the appropriate management level (optimum number of animals on the range -AML)
    is about 27,000 animals. BLM does not have adequate tools to make significant
    progress towards achieving AML and continues remove excess animals from the range
    to address public safety & health issues, court orders, private land encroachment
    and to reach AML in priority habitat areas and to avoid range deterioration. BLM
    plans to reduce population growth by increasing fertility control vaccine applications
    through partnerships, and implementing spay and neuter methods. . BLM looks forward
    to expanding partnerships for long term care of animals and expanding programs
    to increase adoptions and sales.
