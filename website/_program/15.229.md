objective: "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages and protects wild horses and\
  \ burros on 26.9 million acres of public lands across ten western states as part\
  \ of its mission to administer public lands for multiple uses. The Wild Horse and\
  \ Burro Program's goal is to manage healthy wild horses and burros on healthy public\
  \ rangelands. The BLM created the Wild Horse and Burro Program to implement the\
  \ Wild-Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act, passed by Congress in 1971. Broadly,\
  \ the law declares wild horses and burros to be \u201Cliving symbols of the historic\
  \ and pioneer spirit of the West\u201D and stipulates that the BLM and the U.S.\
  \ Forest Service have the responsibility to manage and protect herds in their respective\
  \ jurisdictions within areas where wild horses and burros were found roaming in\
  \ 1971. The Wild Horse and Burro Program consists of two main branches: (1) On-Range\
  \ management of wild horses and burros, and (2) Off-Range management and care of\
  \ wild horses and burros. The goal of the On-Range program is to manage for healthy\
  \ wild horse and burro populations and to maintain a thriving natural ecological\
  \ balance with other resources and land uses. The Off-Range management goal is to\
  \ ensure the health and welfare of wild horses and burros that were removed from\
  \ public lands under BLM care, to place animals into private care through adoptions,\
  \ sales, and transfers, to conduct compliance inspections of adopted animals and\
  \ to build partnerships and relationships with external organizations. Communications,\
  \ outreach, and education are priorities of both branches. This program continues\
  \ to advance the Department of Interior's priorities to address the climate crisis\
  \ and restore balance on public lands and waters."
