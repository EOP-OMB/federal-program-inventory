objective: Under the baseline tax system, a personal exemption would be allowed for
  the taxpayer, as well as for the taxpayerâ€™s spouse and dependents who do not claim
  a personal exemption on their own tax returns. These exemptions are repealed for
  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. However,
  the definitions regarding eligibility for dependent exemptions for children (and
  qualifying relatives), which determine eligibility for a number of family-related
  provisions, remain in place. These provisions include a $500 credit for dependents
  other than qualifying children (Other Dependent Credit, or ODC). In general, to
  be considered a dependent child, a child would have to be under age 19. In contrast,
  the Tax Code allows taxpayers to consider their children aged 19 to 23 as dependents,
  as long as the children are full-time students and reside with the taxpayer for
  over half the year (with exceptions for temporary absences from home, such as for
  school attendance). Absent this provision, children over 18 would need to meet the
  more stringent rules for qualified relatives in order to qualify the taxpayer for
  certain benefits, including the ODC.
