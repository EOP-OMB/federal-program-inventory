objective: "The purpose of this program is to increase market transformation of energy\
  \ efficiency and renewable energy technologies through policies, strategies, and\
  \ public-private partnerships that facilitate their adoption and implementation.\
  \  It also facilitates state-based activities, such as: financing mechanisms for\
  \ institutional retrofit programs; loan program and management; energy savings performance\
  \ contracting; comprehensive residential programs for homeowners; transportation\
  \ programs that accelerate use of alternative fuels; and renewable programs that\
  \ remove barriers and support supply side and distributed renewable energy.\r\n\r\
  \nThe program provides financial and technical assistance to State governments to\
  \ create and implement a variety of energy efficiency and conservation projects\
  \ in order to provide leadership to maximize the benefits of energy efficiency and\
  \ renewable energy through communications and outreach activities, technology deployment,\
  \ and accessing new partnerships and resources across the geographic panorama of\
  \ the United States and its territories.   The program\u2019s objectives are:\r\n\
  \r\n*  To reduce fossil fuel emissions created as a result of activities within\
  \ the jurisdictions of eligible entities;\r\n*  To reduce the total energy use of\
  \ the eligible entities; and\r\n*  To improve energy efficiency in the transportation,\
  \ building, and other sectors."
