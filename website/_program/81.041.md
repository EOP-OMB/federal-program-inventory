objective: "The purpose of this program is to increase market transformation of energy\
  \ efficiency and renewable energy technologies through policies, strategies, and\
  \ public-private partnerships that facilitate their adoption and implementation.\
  \  It also facilitates state-based activities, such as: financing mechanisms for\
  \ institutional retrofit programs; loan program and management; energy savings performance\
  \ contracting; comprehensive residential programs for homeowners; transportation\
  \ programs that accelerate use of alternative fuels; and renewable programs that\
  \ remove barriers and support supply side and distributed renewable energy.\r\n\r\
  \nThe program provides financial and technical assistance to State governments to\
  \ create and implement a variety of energy efficiency and conservation projects\
  \ in order to provide leadership to maximize the benefits of energy efficiency and\
  \ renewable energy through communications and outreach activities, technology deployment,\
  \ and accessing new partnerships and resources across the geographic panorama of\
  \ the United States and its territories.   The programâ€™s objectives are:\r\n\r\n\
  *  To reduce fossil fuel emissions created as a result of activities within the\
  \ jurisdictions of eligible entities;\r\n*  To reduce the total energy use of the\
  \ eligible entities; and\r\n*  To improve energy efficiency in the transportation,\
  \ building, and other sectors."

- description: "SEP implemented the Technology Action Group (TAG) Model for FY 2021.\
    \    A TAG represents a voluntary opportunity to participate in a learning and\
    \ best practices model between the State Energy Program (SEP) and the 56 State\
    \ Energy Offices (SEOs) of the states, territories and the District of Columbia.\
    \ TAGs are voluntary and established as a pilot initiative for FY 2021 through\
    \ FY2022. The two topics are:\n\nOnsite energy systems at critical facilities:\n\
    States work together to develop plans for onsite energy systems that can power\
    \ critical facilities during grid outages and normal operation using lab-designed\
    \ tools.\n                \nMain Street revitalization:\nStates work together\
    \ to identify successful strategies for targeting Main Street communities and\
    \ small businesses to stimulate local energy efficiency projects performed by\
    \ local professionals that reduce energy bills."
