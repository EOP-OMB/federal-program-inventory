objective: The overall goal of Conservation Outreach is to expand conservation assistance
  to  historically underserved farmers and ranchers in participating equitably in
  the full range of agriculture, agribusiness, forestry, and related programs offered
  by Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and to provide opportunities for
