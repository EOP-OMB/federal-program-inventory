objective: The overall goal of Conservation Outreach is to expand conservation assistance
  to  historically underserved farmers and ranchers in participating equitably in
  the full range of agriculture, agribusiness, forestry, and related programs offered
  by Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and to provide opportunities for
  students to pursue careers in agriculture, natural resources and related sciences.  Eligible
  entities may compete for funding on projects that provide education and training
  in agriculture, agribusiness, forestry, agriculturally related services, within
  NRCS programs, and to conduct outreach initiatives.
