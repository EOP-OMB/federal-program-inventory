objective: RFAP seeks to strengthen the quality and expand the scope of fundamental
  and applied research at eligible institutions, by providing them with opportunities
  to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation,
  or remodeling of the facility that supports their research, and research training
  goals and may be too costly and/or not appropriate for support through other NIFA
  grant programs. Projects are financed through a combination of federal matching
  funds and related fundraising from non-federal third parties.
