objective: The Research Facilities Act Program seeks to strengthen the quality and
  expand the scope of fundamental and applied research at eligible institutions, by
  providing them with opportunities to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition,
  modernization, renovation, or remodeling of the facility that supports their research,
  and research training goals and may be too costly and/or not appropriate for support
  through other NIFA grant programs. Projects are financed through a combination of
  federal matching funds and related fundraising from non-federal third parties.
