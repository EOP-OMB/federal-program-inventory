objective: "The purpose of this program is to transition this highly-functional public\
  \ health infrastructure for cancer prevention and control into new roles and functions\
  \ to anticipate the nation\u2019s needs over the next decade.  The goals are to\
  \ (1) seek efficiencies across the management and operations of cancer prevention\
  \ and control programs, (2) focus on high-burden cancers with evidence-based, scalable\
  \ interventions that already exist and can be broadly implemented, (3) develop organized\
  \ screening programs that are more effective and efficient than current opportunistic\
  \ approaches, and (4) maintain high-quality cancer registries and expand their application\
  \ in prevention and screening."
