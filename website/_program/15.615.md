objective: 'Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund grants provide Federal
  financial assistance to States and Territories that have entered into a cooperative
  agreement pursuant to section 6(c) of the Endangered Species Act for species and
  habitat conservation actions on non-Federal lands, including habitat acquisition,
  conservation planning, habitat restoration, status surveys, captive propagation
  and reintroduction, research, and education.


  Traditional Conservation Grants: The principle objective of the Traditional Conservation
  Grant Program is to support the development and implementation of States programs
  to conserve and recover threated and endangered species under the Service''s jurisdiction
  and to monitor candidate, at-risk, and recently delisted species.



  Conservation Planning Assistance Grants: The Conservation Planning Assistance Grant
  program provides funding to States and Territories to support the development of
  new Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs), and Candidate
  Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAAs).  Funding may also be used to support
  the renewal or amendment of existing HCPs, SHAs, and CCAAs.  Funding may be used
  to support development and planning activities such as document preparation, public
  outreach, baseline species surveys, habitat assessments, and inventories.  The preparation
  of environmental compliance review documents, such as National Environmental Policy
  Act (NEPA) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), is also an eligible use
  of grant funds.


  Recovery Land Acquisition Grants: The principle objective of the RLA Grant program
  is to promote State and Federal cooperation in listed species conservation by leveraging
  funds to acquire specific parcels of land, through fee simple or conservation easement,
  in support of Service-approved recovery plans and outlines.  The ESA conveys the
  importance of recovery plans as a central organizing tool for guiding the recovery
  process by requiring their development for every listed species.


  HCP Land Acquisition Grants: Established by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 1997, the
  HCP Land Acquisition Grant program was designed to reduce conflicts between the
  conservation of listed species and competing land uses on specific parcels of land
  associated with approved and permitted HCPs. Under this program, the Service provides
  matching grants to States in support of land acquisition projects that will conserve
  species habitat in perpetuity through fee simple acquisition or the acquisition
  of permanent conservation easements. All land acquired through these grants complements,
  but does not replace, the mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring commitments
  of the HCP. Thus, this work is additive to the conservation commitments entered
  into when HCPs are permitted and serves as a meaningful way to leverage non-Federal
  investment in species recovery and connect conservation lands across the landscape.'
