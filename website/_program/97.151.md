objective: "The goal of the Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) Program is to enhance\
  \ the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and fire-related\
  \ hazards by providing grants to eligible fire departments, national, regional,\
  \ state, local, tribal, and non-profit organizations such as academic (e.g., universities),\
  \ research foundations, public safety institutes, public health, occupational health,\
  \ and injury prevention institutions. The FP&S Program strives to strengthen community\
  \ fire prevention programs and enable innovative solutions to improve firefighter\
  \ safety, health, and well-being. The objectives of the FP&S Program are to award\
  \ grants with a 1 to 4 years period of performance to:\n•\tProvide communities with\
  \ critically needed resources, such as personnel, information, or supplies, to support\
  \ the reduction in residential fire risk, including access to smoke alarm installations,\
  \ home safety assessments, sprinkler awareness, community risk assessments, and\
  \ fire prevention public education and training.\n•\tIncrease the prevalence and\
  \ quality of education and awareness programs on wildfires in and around communities,\
  \ such as areas designated at WUI, including promoting fuel reduction and removal.\n\
  •\tProvide support for the awareness, adoption, reinstatement, and enforcement of\
  \ building codes, such as funding to support personnel to conduct inspections.\n\
  •\tAssist recipients to aggressively investigate every fire through increased equipment,\
  \ training, and personnel resources.\n•\tDisseminate information on a national level\
  \ to positively change firefighter safety, health, and well-being behaviors and\
  \ decision-making.\n•\tReduce firefighter line-of-duty fatalities and injuries through\
  \ research to improve firefighter safety, health, or well-being.\n\nUsing a competitive\
  \ process that is informed by fire service subject-matter experts, grants are awarded\
  \ to applicants whose requests best address the narrative evaluation criteria identified\
  \ in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)."
