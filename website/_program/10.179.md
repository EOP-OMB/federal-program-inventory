objective: 'Eligible agricultural agencies or departments competitively distribute
  grant funds through subawards to eligible entities. Subaward projects funded through
  MGFSP help increase the quantity and quality of locally grown food in food insecure
  communities through the completion of small-scale gardening, herding, livestock
  and other projects that expand access to food and knowledge of food security. The
  eligible agencies or departments are responsible for conducting a subaward competition,
  defining specific details of their subaward programs, and ensuring projects are
  appropriate for the MGFSP. This includes announcing the availability of funding,
  conducting public outreach, recruiting reviewers, and administering the subaward
  competition.

  In addition, eligible agricultural agencies or state departments are responsible
  for administratively overseeing awarded subrecipients. This includes ensuring subrecipients
  maintain appropriate records, monitoring subaward projects for compliance with applicable
  Federal statutes and regulations and applicable AMS General Terms and Conditions,
  collecting project data, reporting on program outcomes and statutory requirements,
  and submitting reports to AMS.'
