objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation and remuneration, including
  dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In
  contrast, under current law selfemployed taxpayers may deduct their family health
  insurance premiums. Taxpayers without self-employment income are not eligible for
  this special deduction. The deduction is not available for any month in which the
  self-employed individual is eligible to participate in an employer-subsidized health
  plan and the deduction may not exceed the self-employed individualâ€™s earned income
  from self-employment.
