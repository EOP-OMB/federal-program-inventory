objective: The Great Waters Research Collaborative (GWRC) is a collaboration whose
  objective is to end the problem of ship-mediated invasive species in the Great Lakes-St.
  Lawrence Seaway System. The near term objective is to significantly accelerate research,
  development and implementation of ballast water treatment system for ships that
  operate in the Great Lakes.

- description: Conducted bench-scale testing of 2 promising fresh water ballast water
    treatments.
  year: '2019'
- description: Funds have been used to further the current efforts that address the
    curtailment of aquatic invasive species within the Great Lakes as associated with
    ballast water operations and other aquatic invasive species issues associated
    with commercial shipping.
  year: '2022'
- description: 'Several multi-year research projects were completed: Assessing effectiveness
    of potential emerging or alternative viability assessment methods for BWMS biological
    efficacy evaluation;  Determining effectiveness of assessment methods for evaluating
    the mortality and/or viability of eggs and resting stages of organisms exposed
    to ballast water treatment; Determining if there is a method that can be used
    to accurately assess the environmental acceptability of treated and neutralized
    ballast water upon discharge, and; Determine whether environmental monitoring
    sensors exist that are accurate, are capable of measuring parameters of interest
    to commercial vessels (followed by piloting them in port conditions).'
