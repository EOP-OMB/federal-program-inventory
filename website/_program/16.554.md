  \ of identifying ineligible firearm purchases and persons ineligible to hold positions\
  \ involving children, the elderly, or the disabled.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage\
  \ of state or tribal records that are automated. \n\n2) Ensure the development of\
  \ the infrastructure connects each state’s and tribe’s record systems to national\
  \ records and connects each state’s background check databases to other states.\n\
  \nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage of records accessible through the III;\n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 2: Number of states and tribes submitting records to the FBI’s III and\
  \ NICS Indices;\n\nPerformance Measure 3: Number of states and tribes participating\

- description: "•\tIncreased participation in Interstate Identification Index (III):\
    \ Since 1993, the number of states participating in the FBI’s III grew from 26\
    \ to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. There are over 95 million fingerprint-supported\
    \ criminal history records accessible through III and available at the time of\
    \ a background check. An average of 30 million of such exchanges occur monthly\
    \ for criminal justice and noncriminal justice purposes.\n•\tNational Instant\
    \ Criminal Background Check System (NICS): Developed, in part, through NCHIP funding,\
    \ the NICS now supports over 25 million record checks annually at the presale\
    \ stage of firearms purchases. The number of electronically available records\
    \ checked at the time of a firearm background check was nearly 100 million at\
    \ year-end 2017, the latest data available from the FBI.\n•\tDomestic Violence\
    \ and Protection Orders: States can submit data and flag criminal history records\
    \ showing convictions for domestic violence or protection orders against people.\
    \ All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories are submitting\
    \ records of active protection orders to the NCIC Protection Order File. As of\
    \ September 30, 2018, the NCIC Protection Order file contained over 1.8 million\
    \ active orders. An additional 74,000 protection orders were available for firearm-related\
    \ background checks in the NICS Indices."
