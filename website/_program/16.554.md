objective: "GOAL(S): Ensuring the quality and completeness of the nation’s criminal\
  \ history record systems by providing financial and technical assistance to states\
  \ and tribes for the establishment or improvement of computerized criminal history\
  \ record systems and related systems capturing data on mental health and protective\
  \ orders. \n\nOBJECTIVE(S):  \n1) Improve data accessibility and support data transmissions\
  \ to national systems that will permit the immediate identification of persons who\
  \ are prohibited from purchasing firearms, are subject to domestic violence protective\
  \ orders, or are ineligible to hold positions of responsibility involving children,\
  \ the elderly, or the disabled. \n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage of state or\
  \ tribal records that are automated. \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number of states\
  \ and tribes submitting records to the FBI’s NICS Indices.\n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 3: Number of states and tribes participating the FBI’s NCIC Protection Order File.\n\
  \n2) Ensure that criminal justice systems are designed, implemented, or upgraded\
  \ to be compliant where applicable, with the FBI-operated National Instant Criminal\
  \ Background Check System and  Next Generation Identification System (NGI), meet\
  \ other applicable statewide or regional criminal justice information sharing standards\
  \ and plans.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of states and tribes participating\
  \ in the FBI’s NGI fingerprint capture.\n\nPerformance Measure 2: Percentage of\
  \ records accessible through the FBI’s Interstate Identification Index (III). \n\

  year: '2018'
- description: "•\tIncreased participation in Interstate Identification Index (III):\
    \ Since 1993, the number of states participating in the FBI’s III grew from 26\
    \ to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. There are over 95 million fingerprint-supported\
    \ criminal history records accessible through III and available at the time of\
    \ a background check. An average of 30 million of such exchanges occur monthly\
    \ for criminal justice and noncriminal justice purposes.\n•\tNational Instant\
    \ Criminal Background Check System (NICS): Developed, in part, through NCHIP funding,\
    \ the NICS now supports over 25 million record checks annually at the presale\
    \ stage of firearms purchases. The number of electronically available records\
    \ checked at the time of a firearm background check was nearly 100 million at\
    \ year-end 2017, the latest data available from the FBI.\n•\tDomestic Violence\
    \ and Protection Orders: States can submit data and flag criminal history records\
    \ showing convictions for domestic violence or protection orders against people.\
    \ All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories are submitting\
    \ records of active protection orders to the NCIC Protection Order File. As of\
    \ September 30, 2018, the NCIC Protection Order file contained over 1.8 million\
    \ active orders. An additional 74,000 protection orders were available for firearm-related\
    \ background checks in the NICS Indices."
