objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates, or
  deferral of tax, to apply to certain types or sources of income. Dealers in real
  and personal property (i.e., sellers who regularly hold property for sale or resale)
  cannot defer taxable income from installment sales until the receipt of the loan
  repayment. Nondealers (i.e., sellers of real property used in their business) are
  required to pay interest on deferred taxes attributable to their total installment
  obligations in excess of $5 million. Only properties with sales prices exceeding
  $150,000 are includable in the total. The payment of a market rate of interest eliminates
  the benefit of the tax deferral. The tax exemption for nondealers with total installment
  obligations of less than $5 million is, therefore, a tax expenditure.
