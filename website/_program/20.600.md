objective: The State and Community Highway Safety funding program is administered
  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) at the Federal level
  and by the State Highway Safety Offices (SHSO) at the State level.  The formula
  grant funding facilitates a coordinated national highway safety program to reduce
  traffic crashes, deaths, injuries, and property damage. Each State may use these
  grant funds only for behavioral highway safety purposes to improve traffic safety
  for travelers using public roadways.  At least 40 percent of these funds are to
  be used by political subdivisions of the State to address local traffic safety problems.
