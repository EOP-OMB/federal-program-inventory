objective: The State and Community Highway Safety funding program is administered
  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) at the Federal level
  and by the State Highway Safety Offices (SHSO) at the State level.  The formula
  grant funding facilitates a coordinated national highway safety program to reduce

  funds are to be used by political subdivisions of the State to address local traffic
  safety problems.
