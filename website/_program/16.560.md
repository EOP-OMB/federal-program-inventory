    \ armor the most important safety equipment used by the Nation’s law enforcement\
    \ officers.\n•\tNIJ leads the federal government’s research efforts to combat\
    \ human trafficking as well as to develop strategies to prevent individuals from\
    \ becoming committed to terrorist ideologies. \n•\tNIJ-funded research in the\
    \ use of computers for crime analysis and mapping laid the groundwork for the\
    \ present, near-pervasive adoption of crime analysis technology. \n•\tNIJ is the\
    \ only federal agency investing in and supporting the development of the robotic\
    \ systems that are now used in the majority of U.S. forensic DNA laboratories.\n\
    •\tNIJ funded the development of the Rapid DNA systems now being used in certain\
    \ forensic laboratories."
