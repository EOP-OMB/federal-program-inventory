objective: Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed
  when assets are transferred by gift. In contrast, when a gift of appreciated asset
  is made under current law, the donor’s basis in the transferred property (the cost
  that was incurred when the transferred property was first acquired) carries over
  to the donee. The carryover of the donor’s basis allows a continued deferral of
  unrealized capital gains.
