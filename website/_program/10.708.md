objective: 'Provide assistance to supplement the capital costs 1) for installing a
  wood energy system that utilizes wood and wood biomass (including residuals) as
  the primary fuels source and 2) for building an innovative wood products facility
  which can include the facility, equipment, and/or equipment systems. Projects that
  support the wood energy program may include: 1) single facility central heating
  systems; 2) district heating systems that service several buildings; 3) combined
  heat and electric systems where thermal is the primary energy output. Projects that
  support the wood innovations program may include: 1) building components or systems
  that use large panelized wood construction, including mass timber; 2) wood products
  derived from nanotechnology or other new technology processes 3) other innovative
  wood products that use low-value, low-quality wood.

  Projects should support one or more criteria: 1) latest technology boiler controls
  or control systems; 2) carried out in a location where markets are needed for the
  low value, low quality wood; 3) carried out in a location with limited access to
  natural gas pipelines; 4) include the use of or retrofitting (or both) of existing
  sawmill facilities located in a location where the average annual unemployment rate
  exceeded the national average unemployment rate by more than 1 percent during the
  previous calendar year; or carried out in a location where the project would aid
  with forest restoration.'

    Wood Grant Program. Eighteen proposals across the 16 states with funding of $14,864,684
    and leveraging $ 47,556,694 were supported.

    Among all the funded projects, 72% of the projects support Disadvantaged Communities
    as defined by the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), 11% of
    the projects support High-Risk Firesheds as defined by the Wildfire Crisis Strategy
    (FS-1187f) and 6% of the projects support Wildfire Crisis Strategy Landscapes
    as defined by the Wildfire Crisis Strategy (FS-1187f).'
