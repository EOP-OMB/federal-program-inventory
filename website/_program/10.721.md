results:
- description: In FY 2024, new temporary bridge rental programs were established in
    8 States and with 7 Tribes, while existing temporary bridge rental programs were
    expanded in 7 States and with 3 Tribes.  Temporary bridge programs include fee
    rental, no-cost rental, and rent-to-own programs which are designed to make temporary
    bridges available to loggers, contractors, and State and Tribal operators for
    crossing watercourses during forest management operations.  These programs use
    temporary bridges in place of constructing temporary “ford” crossings or installing
    temporary culverts to cross watercourses, protecting streambanks and improving
    water quality.  Temporary bridges may be reused and allow for normal streamflow,
    making these programs more cost effective than constructing ford crossings or
    installing temporary culverts, and provide improved access for forest management
    activities, particularly following rain events or in sensitive watersheds.
