layout: program
objective: (1) To focus on development and demonstration of modeling/simulation technologies
  and methodologies through the structure of Multidisciplinary Simulation Centers,
  Single-Disciplinary Centers, and Focus Investigatory Centers to solve open science
  and engineering problems relevant to NNSA Defense Programs missions; (2) to promote
  and sustain scientific interactions between the academic community and scientists
  at the NNSA laboratories; (3) and to train scientists in specific areas of long-term
  research relevant to NNSA stockpile stewardship.

results:
- description: 'The budget projection for FY 2016 is $18M with $4M going to each three
    MSC Centers and $2M for each of three SDC Centers. The accomplishment during FY16
    are as follows:  University of Utah, completed a massive rewrite of the Uintah
    runtime to incorporate Kokkos and multiple C++11 constructs.  Developed a hybrid
    uncertainty quantification methodology for achieving predictivity with extrapolation
    that integrates Bayesian and Bound-to-Bound methodologies. Developed and taught
    two new graduate courses on Center themes (V/UQ and coal combustion).  University
    of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign increased phyusics fidelity of predictive models
    based on uncertainty quantification and detailed bench-top diagnostics. Advanced
    experimental diagnostics to inform model development. Hosted the Workshop on Exascale
    Software Technologies in Albuquerque which provided a platform to broadly discuss
    forthcoming tools, challenges, and best practices to realize performance at exascale.  Stanford
    University performed scalable high-fidelity radiation transport implemented in
    Soleil-MPI. Also they accomplished assessment of effect of particle-size uncertainty
    on flow/particle exit temperature.  University of Florida developed CMT-bone as
    a proxy app for CMT-nek, validated it using the Veritas tool from LLNL, and developed
    an initial CPU-GPU implementation.  They conducted additional simulations of shock
    interaction with particles at lower Mach numbers to emulate SNL experiments as
    well as conduct simulations at blast conditions.  Texas A&M University completed
    calibration and validation of Impurity Model 1.  Implemented extruded unstructured
    triangular mesh capability in PDT transport code; and implemented initial load-balancing
    algorithm for unstructured meshes.  University of Notre Dame developed poro-visco-plastic
    constitutive model for metal powders, and advanced image-based modeling pipeline
    for micro-to-macro simulations.  Performed full system demonstration simulations
    and validated them against experiments.  Performed predictive damage multiscale
    simulations using up to 128,000 cores.  '
