objective: To comprehensively address the causes of fish habitat decline by working
  together with partners to maximize the impact of limited funding for fish habitat
  conservation. Under NFHP, Federal, State, Tribal, and privately-raised funds are
  leveraged through 20 Fish Habitat Partnerships to address the fish habitat challenges.
  More information about the Fish Habitat Partnerships and their partners can be found
  online at www.fishhabitat.org. Each partnership supports distinct habitat or species
  based conservation priorities.
