objective: "The Federal Transit Administration's Research, Development, Demonstration,\
  \ Deployment, Cooperative Research, Technical Assistance, Standards Development,\
  \ and Human Resources and Training programs  are authorized at 49 U.S.C. 5312, and\
  \ 5314 and collectively seek to develop  solutions that improve public transportation.\
  \ Its primary goals are to increase transit ridership, improve safety and emergency\
  \ preparedness, improve operating efficiencies, protect the environment, promote\
  \ energy independence, and provide transit research leadership; develop and conduct\
  \ workforce development activities, training and educational programs for Federal,\
  \ State, and local transportation employees, United States citizens, and foreign\
  \ nationals engaged or to be engaged in public transportation work; and to sponsor\
  \ development of voluntary and consensus-based standards to more effectively and\
  \ efficiently provide transit service, as well as support the improved administration\
  \ of Federal transit funds. To accomplish this, FTA funds projects to support  research\
  \ and development, demonstration, deployments of various technologies and operational\
  \ models for transit;  a national cooperative research program, a national training\
  \ institute, national technical assistance centers, and transit workforce development\
  \ programs.    \n\nThe Public Transportation Innovation program (49 U.S.C. 5312)\
  \ supports research, development, demonstration, deployment, and evaluation projects.\
  \  Research projects in this area are not generally undertaken by the private sector\
  \ including studies on transit policy issues, operational efficiency, and travel\
  \ behavior.  These projects will promote the use of clean energy and air quality\
  \ improvement.  The program also funds long-term, high-risk, high-potential payoff\
  \ investigations of new technologies, which is critical to developing a public transportation\
  \ system that is efficient, attractive, and reliable. The majority of the funds\
  \ (75 percent) appropriated under 49 U.S.C 5338 to support this section, must be\
  \ used for a discretionary Low and No Emission deployment program. \n\nThe Transit\
  \ Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) (49.U.S.C 5312) funds shorter-term research\
  \ projects that address immediate operational issues facing the transit industry.\
  \  These projects are designed to identify immediate improvements in transit safety,\
  \ equipment and system design, system operations, and the economic development impact\
  \ of transit investments, among other topic areas. These funds are typically awarded\
  \ to the National Academies of Science which has managed the TCRP since its inception\
  \ in 1992. \n\nThe Technical Assistance and Standards (49 U.S.C. 5314) funds support\
  \ provide resources and direct assistance to support compliance with the Americans\
  \ with Disabilities Act (ADA), human services transportation coordination requirements,\
  \ the transportation needs of elderly individuals, increased transit ridership,\
  \ transportation equity needs, and any other technical assistance activities deemed\
  \ necessary by FTA, such as improvements in safety and asset management.\n\nThe\
  \ Human Resources and Training program (49. U.S.C 5314) awards grants to transit\
  \ agencies and other entities for workforce development programs and projects."
