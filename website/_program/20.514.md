objective: "The Federal Transit Administration's Research, Development, Demonstration,\
  \ Deployment, Cooperative Research, Technical Assistance, Standards Development,\
  \ and Human Resources and Training programs  are authorized at 49 U.S.C. 5312, and\
  \ 5314 and collectively seek to develop  solutions that improve public transportation.\
  \ Its primary goals are to increase transit ridership, improve safety and emergency\
  \ preparedness, improve operating efficiencies, protect the environment, promote\
  \ energy independence, and provide transit research leadership; develop and conduct\
  \ workforce development activities, training and educational programs for Federal,\
  \ State, and local transportation employees, United States citizens, and foreign\
  \ nationals engaged or to be engaged in public transportation work; and to sponsor\
  \ development of voluntary and consensus-based standards to more effectively and\
  \ efficiently provide transit service, as well as support the improved administration\
  \ of Federal transit funds. To accomplish this, FTA funds projects to support  research\
  \ and development, demonstration, deployments of various technologies and operational\
  \ models for transit;  a national cooperative research program, a national training\
  \ institute, national technical assistance centers, and transit workforce development\
  \ programs.    \n\nThe Public Transportation Innovation program (49 U.S.C. 5312)\
  \ supports research, development, demonstration, deployment, and evaluation projects.\
  \  Research projects in this area are not generally undertaken by the private sector\
  \ including studies on transit policy issues, operational efficiency, and travel\
  \ behavior.  These projects will promote the use of clean energy and air quality\
  \ improvement.  The program also funds long-term, high-risk, high-potential payoff\
  \ investigations of new technologies, which is critical to developing a public transportation\
  \ system that is efficient, attractive, and reliable. The majority of the funds\
  \ (75 percent) appropriated under 49 U.S.C 5338 to support this section, must be\
  \ used for a discretionary Low and No Emission deployment program. \n\nThe Transit\
  \ Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) (49.U.S.C 5312) funds shorter-term research\
  \ projects that address immediate operational issues facing the transit industry.\
  \  These projects are designed to identify immediate improvements in transit safety,\
  \ equipment and system design, system operations, and the economic development impact\
  \ of transit investments, among other topic areas. These funds are typically awarded\
  \ to the National Academies of Science which has managed the TCRP since its inception\
  \ in 1992. \n\nThe Technical Assistance and Standards (49 U.S.C. 5314) funds support\
  \ provide resources and direct assistance to support compliance with the Americans\
  \ with Disabilities Act (ADA), human services transportation coordination requirements,\
  \ the transportation needs of elderly individuals, increased transit ridership,\
  \ transportation equity needs, and any other technical assistance activities deemed\
  \ necessary by FTA, such as improvements in safety and asset management.\n\nThe\
  \ Human Resources and Training program (49. U.S.C 5314) awards grants to transit\
  \ agencies and other entities for workforce development programs and projects."

- description: "FTA continued to implement new programs and manage active programs\
    \ in accordance with current Federal Public Transportation Law and FTA’s research\
    \ vision that innovative technologies, projects, partnerships, and world-class\
    \ Infrastructure promote economic growth, productivity, safety, and improve quality\
    \ of life in communities. FTA’s research mission is to advance public transportation\
    \ innovation by leading research, development, demonstration, deployment, evaluation,\
    \ and implementation practices and technologies that, enhance effectiveness, increase\
    \ efficiency, expand quality, promote safety, and ultimately improve the transit\
    \ rider’s experience. FTA awarded agreements for research, development, demonstration,\
    \ and deployment projects, and evaluation of research and technology of national\
    \ significance to public transportation that improves public transportation in\
    \ our nation. \r\n\r\nProjects were chosen through a new transparent, participatory,\
    \ and consensus oriented planning process. Also, as there is a five-year authorization,\
    \ FTA is developing a five-year strategic plan. Following are top accomplishments\
    \ for FY 2016, and for further information on FY 2016 research projects and their\
    \ accomplishments please see the 2016 FTA annual research report which can be\
    \ found at the following URL: https://www.transit.dot.gov/research-innovation/fta-annual-report-fy-2016-public-transportation-innovation-research-projects-fta\r\
    \n\r\nTo support infrastructure capital investment innovations, FTA established\
    \ a new testing program to assess low or no emission vehicle (LoNo) components.\
    \ The program provides assessments of low- or no-emission vehicle components,\
    \ documenting (at a minimum) the maintainability, reliability, performance, structural\
    \ integrity, efficiency, and noise of the tested components and continues FTA’s\
    \ legacy of supporting the transit industry in the introduction of advanced technologies\
    \ to reduce the energy consumption and emissions of transit buses. FTA selected\
    \ The Ohio State University and Auburn University to receive research funds to\
    \ conduct the program.  Both universities will conduct testing, evaluation, and\
    \ analysis of low or no emission (LoNo) components intended for use in LoNo transit\
    \ buses used to provide public transportation.\r\n\r\nTo enhance safety in public\
    \ transportation systems, the Safety, Resiliency, and All-Hazards Emergency Response\
    \ and Recovery Research Demonstrations (SRER) Program carried out by FTA continued\
    \ to work with grantees who are developing and testing new innovative technologies\
    \ in safety. One example is the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA)\
    \ project that is mitigating the risks of one of the most hazardous roles in rail\
    \ transportation – inspecting and maintaining track and wayside infrastructure.\
    \ MARTA partnered with Bombardier to deploy six miles of TrackSafe technology\
    \ on MARTA's rail system to improve track worker safety and reduce hazards associated\
    \ with track inspection, maintenance, and repair. The technology alerts track\
    \ workers to the presence of an approaching train, and train operators and control\
    \ center staff to the specific location of workers. FTA is also leading projects\
    \ to develop safety standards and improve safety culture in collaboration with\
    \ national industry experts.\r\n\r\nMobility innovations were accomplished through\
    \ the Ride to Wellness Program aimed which is seeking to increase access to care,\
    \ improve health outcomes, and lower healthcare costs through increased partnerships\
    \ between public transportation and health providers.  To help agencies identify\
    \ ways to utilize automation, an active FY 2016 project is developing materials\
    \ to help in the planning and executing of U.S. DOT-sponsored transit automation\
    \ development and demonstration projects. And, the Accessible Transportation Technology\
    \ Research Initiative (ATTRI) is researching innovative technologies that can\
    \ increase independence and mobility for people living with disabilities.\r\n\r\
    \nA yearly statutory program in Section 5312, is the Transit Cooperative Research\
    \ Program (TCRP): with the National Academies of Science. This cooperative agreement\
    \ funded transit research activities as recommended by the TCRP Oversight and\
    \ Project Selection (TOPS) Committee, an independent governing board for TCRP.\
    \ For more information on the projects funded and major accomplishments for TCRP,\
    \ please see their annual report at the following URL: http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/TCRPAnnual2016.pdf\r\
    \n\r\nFTA held a Workforce Development Summit in Washington, DC on June 7, 2016.\
    \ The meeting was attended by 45 representatives of current active grantees and\
    \ former FTA recipients, allowing discussions focused on the workforce challenges\
    \ facing the public transportation industry, innovative projects conducted by\
    \ grant recipients, collaboration opportunities and the importance of partnerships,\
    \ funding opportunities, and performance measurement.\r\n\r\nFTA funds the National\
    \ Transit Institute Program (NTI), and over the last NTI delivered 322 training\
    \ courses throughout the U.S. to 7,738 participants with an average cost per course\
    \ of about $13,000 and an average cost per participant of approximately $580.\
    \ In addition, NTI conducted 120 sessions of All Hazards Awareness and Preparedness\
    \ for Transit Employees in preparation for Super Bowl 50 at Levi’s Stadium in\
    \ Santa Clara, California in February 2016, with 1,437 staff of the Santa Clara\
    \ Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) trained. The National Transit Institute\
    \ (NTI) continued its focus to develop and deploy training programs for the public\
    \ transportation industry. NTI held a workforce summit on behalf of FTA, and over\
    \ a year period fielded over 300 courses training over 7,200 people.\r\n\r\nIn\
    \ FY 2016, FTA continued to fund two technical assistance centers: the National\
    \ Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), and the National Center\
    \ for Mobility Management (NCMM), \r\n\r\nAccomplishments for the NADTC in 2016\
    \ included developing online courses on Section 5310 and other areas; awarding\
    \ eight community grants; holding five webinars, launching a new website with\
    \ useful materials that benefit older adults, individuals with disabilities, caregivers,\
    \ and public transportation providers; and supporting 800# inquiries through the\
    \ Eldercare Locator. Additionally, the NADTC provided targeted technical assistance\
    \ in response to locally-identified challenges.\r\n\r\nNCMM supported FTA by funding\
    \ $400,000 in planning grants to 16 communities for the development of innovative\
    \ solutions to healthcare access transportation challenges. Local coalitions of\
    \ cross-industry providers, including consumers, spanning the healthcare, transportation,\
    \ human service, and other industries, developed replicable strategies to enhance\
    \ access to preventive, dialysis, behavioral health, and post-hospitalization\
    \ care. NCMM also organized and hosted Peer Exchanges in Baltimore and Austin\
    \ (Texas), allowing transit agencies and MPOs an opportunity to learn from each\
    \ other about effective transit planning. The NCMM also continued to provide support\
    \ to communities and shared best practices around the field of mobility management\
    \ and in the area of coordinated planning.\r\n"
