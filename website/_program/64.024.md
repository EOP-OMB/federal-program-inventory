objective: 'The VA Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program is VA’s largest
  transitional housing program for Veterans experiencing homelessness and is permanently
  authorized under Public Law 109-461.


  Since 1994, the GPD Program has awarded grants to community-based organizations
  to provide transitional housing with wraparound supportive services to assist vulnerable
  Veterans move into permanent housing. The grants are designed to meet Veterans at
  various stages as they move to stable housing. Community-based organizations receiving
  GPD grants offer focused transitional housing services through a variety of housing
  models targeted to different populations and needs of Veterans. The GPD program
  plays a vital role in the continuum of homeless services by providing supportive
  services to those Veterans who would otherwise be among the unsheltered homeless
  population. The result of GPD programs is that Veterans achieve residential stability,
  increase their skill levels and/or income, and obtain greater self-determination.'
