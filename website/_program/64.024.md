objective: "The VA Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program is VA\u2019\
  s largest transitional housing program for Veterans experiencing homelessness and\
  \ is permanently authorized under Public Law 109-461.\n\nSince 1994, the GPD Program\
  \ has awarded grants to community-based organizations to provide transitional housing\
  \ with wraparound supportive services to assist vulnerable Veterans move into permanent\
  \ housing. The grants are designed to meet Veterans at various stages as they move\
  \ to stable housing. Community-based organizations receiving GPD grants offer focused\
  \ transitional housing services through a variety of housing models targeted to\
  \ different populations and needs of Veterans. The GPD program plays a vital role\
  \ in the continuum of homeless services by providing supportive services to those\
  \ Veterans who would otherwise be among the unsheltered homeless population. The\
  \ result of GPD programs is that Veterans achieve residential stability, increase\
  \ their skill levels and/or income, and obtain greater self-determination."
