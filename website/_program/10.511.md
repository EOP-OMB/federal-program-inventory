objective: 'The Smith-Lever Special Needs Competitive Grants Program (SLSNCGP), Assistance
  supports innovative, education-based approaches to address disaster preparedness
  and specific responses related to disasters or disaster threats caused by natural,
  human-made, or technological hazards, or by other factors that contribute to the
  exposure or vulnerability of a community. The goals and objectives of SLSNCGP include
  supporting quality of life in communities across the U.S. by addressing disaster
  preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation in food and agricultural systems.
  The SLSNCGP also seeks to continue to provide information and resources to USDA
  target audiences, stakeholders, and collaborators to improve decision-making before,
  during, and after disasters.


  The Joint Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-grant Institutions and University
  of the District of Columbia Public Postsecondary Education Reorganization Act Program
  (DCPPERA) supports cooperative agricultural extension activities at Land-grant Institutions.

  The Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-grant Institutions (Smith-Lever
  Special Needs) (SLSN) program supports innovative, education-based approaches to
  addressing extension education and services to these limited resource farm families
  to help them achieve desirable results. Methods may include, but are not limited
  to, collaboration with other organizations, appraising resources for capability
  of improvement in agriculture or introduction of industry designed to supplement
  farm income, other new farming ventures or new technologies. The SLSN program seeks
  to increase the level of agricultural extension activities and reach out to limited
  resource farm families at a disadvantage for agricultural development because their
  operations are too small, have low productivity, or are unable to make adjustments
  to establish profitable operations or profitable employment.'
