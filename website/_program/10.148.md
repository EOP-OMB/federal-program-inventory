objective: The Emergency Livestock Relief Program (ELRP) provides direct financial
  assistance to livestock producers for losses incurred because of qualifying drought
  or wildfire in calendar year 2021. Phase 1 provided assistance to eligible livestock
  producers who faced increased supplemental feed costs resulting from forage losses
  whose data was on file with FSA due to their participation in the 2021 Livestock
  Forage Disaster Program. Phase 2 will provide additional assistance to Phase 1 producers
  who suffered additional eligible losses to winter grazing due to the severe impact
  drought and wildfires caused during the grazing period in calendar year 2021 that
  were not covered by Phase 1.
