objective: "DHS S&T seeks to establish a university-led consortium that work closely\
  \ with DHS Components and their partners to conduct research, develop and transition\
  \ mission-relevant science and technology and educate the next generation of homeland\
  \ security technical and scientific challenges identified by DHS components. To\
  \ accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following Centers of Excellence\
  \ (COEs) and associated objectives:\n\nThe Arctic Domain Awareness Center (ADAC)\
  \ will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition\
  \ in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime\
  \ environment issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research, education,\
  \ and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and\
  \ extreme and remote maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced\
  \ team of researchers is required to create an integrated array of research and\
  \ education programs in the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis,\
  \ and resilience research; 2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology\
  \ research.  DHS is interested in pursuing research that will address the needs\
  \ and technological shortfalls that enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators\
  \ to respond to catastrophic events.  Greater situational awareness in the Arctic\
  \ maritime domain, including the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement\
  \ to prevent and respond to incidents of national significance.\n\nThe Center for\
  \ Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will conduct end-user focused research\
  \ to enhance the application of analytic tools to enable the DHS components and\
  \ offices to realize achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support\
  \ real-time decision making to address homeland security-related threats and hazards.\
  \ The research will provide technologies, education and training to improve data\
  \ management and analysis, to facilitate operations research and systems analysis,\
  \ to identify the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically\
  \ assess risks to DHS missions and the people and property they protect. DHS expects\
  \ this Center to develop the next generation of applied mathematical, computational,\
  \ and statistical theory (including algorithms and methods), and to advance the\
  \ quantitative analytical capabilities of DHS components and offices and their partners.\
  \ This Center also will provide quantitative and analytical tools to administrators,\
  \ investigators, field operators, and analysts across DHS components.\n\nThe Cross\
  \ Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research and\
  \ develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations  that\
  \ detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards\
  \ that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s people, agriculture, and economy.\
  \  This Center\u2019s research will provide innovations and methods to improve biothreat\
  \ screening and detection, prevention, and support response.  Researchers will seek\
  \ to understand how advances in bioengineering can support the needs of operators\
  \ in the field when confronted with emerging threats, both naturally occurring and\
  \ in situations involving intentional exposures. The Center will also research how\
  \ to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from diagnostics, genetics, sensors,\
  \ and the environment. Today\u2019s analysts, first responders, professionals in\
  \ public and animal health, and operators in the field are confronted with enormous\
  \ amounts of data which, if understood, could assist in improving our ability to\
  \ identify threats earlier and make decisions that save lives and the economy.\n\
  \nThe Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center will provide solutions\
  \ to enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational\
  \ criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal\
  \ use and exploitation of the cyber domain. CINA will develop and conduct research\
  \ and education programs that will help DHS and its partners enhance investigation\
  \ strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border\
  \ criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber\
  \ domain. The Center will provide education and professional development to improve\
  \ the cost-effectiveness of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction and\
  \ prevention. CINA will also develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products, and\
  \ technology-based solutions for agents, officers and investigators to better coordinate\
  \ investigative strategies and operations to predict, avert and prosecute trans-national\
  \ crimes. \n\nThe Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) will conduct\
  \ research and education that will enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to prepare\
  \ and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS and its\
  \ partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect the Nation\u2019\
  s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach, researchers will investigate multiple\
  \ linked industrial sectors, utilities, and public services. These entities collectively\
  \ prove critical to business continuity and community recovery within a specific\
  \ metropolitan area. The place-based approach will allow CIRI to develop solutions\
  \ to enhance preparedness and recovery of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\
  \ systems. Critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether\
  \ physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or\
  \ destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,\
  \ national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n\nThe Coastal Resilience\
  \ Center (CRC) will conduct research and education to enhance the Nation\u2019s\
  \ ability to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic coastal\
  \ natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The Coastal Resilience Center\
  \ also will consider future climate trends and their impacts on coastal resilience.\
  \ Areas of research will include coastal infrastructure resilience, building resilient\
  \ communities, and disaster dynamics. The overarching goal of the Center will be\
  \ to advance our understanding of coastal hazards to benefit a large number of public\
  \ and private entities. DHS anticipates this research will produce tangible research\
  \ and education results for use by DHS, other federal agencies, state and local\
  \ governments, and other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize\
  \ the Threat RealitY (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting transportation\
  \ environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration across public\
  \ and private entities, and producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded\
  \ spaces with novel design concepts. There are growing threats from malicious threat\
  \ actors that target unsecure spaces where they can inflict the gravest injury to\
  \ human life and property. These threats result in physical, psychological, and\
  \ financial losses on the individual, collective and societal level to the American\
  \ population. To address these threats, DHS can make a difference by ensuring future\
  \ public and private investment in urban infrastructure includes security principals.\
  \ DHS seeks research that will ensure the Departments long-term needs are considered\
  \ when infrastructure recapitalization occurs. SENTRY's research will directly support\
  \ the department\u2019s strategic framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence.\
  \ The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional\
  \ methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.\n\nThe Maritime\
  \ Security Center (MSC) will continue ongoing research and education activities\
  \ in coordination with U.S. Coast Guard and other customers to facilitate transition\
  \ of appropriate projects to DHS components and advance integrated education efforts.\
  \ MSC research projects focus on the following areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis,\
  \ and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology\
  \ Research; and Integration of Science and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance\
  \ and Policy Research. In addition to pursuing key research and education initiatives\
  \ based on DHS challenges, the Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge,\
  \ technical skills, and leadership capabilities of the Nation\u2019s current and\
  \ prospective maritime security workforce. At the core of the Center\u2019s mission\
  \ is the transfer of its research and expertise into relevant, innovative educational\
  \ programs. The Center\u2019s educational programs leverage the subject matter expertise\
  \ and research assets of its academic partners and stakeholder network to provide\
  \ multidisciplinary and experiential learning opportunities for students and tailored\
  \ programs for professional audiences.\n\nThe National Counterterrorism Innovation,\
  \ Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center will conduct research and develop solutions,\
  \ protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations that detect, assess, and\
  \ respond to domestic terrorist activities that would harm the people and infrastructure\
  \ of the United States. The Center\u2019s research portfolio will focus on four\
  \ major theme areas: the nature of counterterrorism operations, development of the\
  \ Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, Terrorism Prevention, and\
  \ Workforce Development. The Center will provide education and professional development\
  \ to ensure that the current and future homeland security enterprise workforce is\
  \ adequately trained and educated to prepare for and respond to terrorist activities."
