objective: "DHS S&T seeks to establish a university-led consortium that work closely\
  \ with DHS Components and their partners to conduct research, develop and transition\
  \ mission-relevant science and technology and educate the next generation of homeland\
  \ security technical and scientific challenges identified by DHS components. To\
  \ accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following Centers of Excellence\
  \ (COEs) and associated objectives:\n\nThe Arctic Domain Awareness Center (ADAC)\
  \ will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition\
  \ in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime\
  \ environment issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research, education,\
  \ and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and\
  \ extreme and remote maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced\
  \ team of researchers is required to create an integrated array of research and\
  \ education programs in the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis,\
  \ and resilience research; 2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology\
  \ research.  DHS is interested in pursuing research that will address the needs\
  \ and technological shortfalls that enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators\
  \ to respond to catastrophic events.  Greater situational awareness in the Arctic\
  \ maritime domain, including the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement\
  \ to prevent and respond to incidents of national significance.\n\nThe Center for\
  \ Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will conduct end-user focused research\
  \ to enhance the application of analytic tools to enable the DHS components and\
  \ offices to realize achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support\
  \ real-time decision making to address homeland security-related threats and hazards.\
  \ The research will provide technologies, education and training to improve data\
  \ management and analysis, to facilitate operations research and systems analysis,\
  \ to identify the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically\
  \ assess risks to DHS missions and the people and property they protect. DHS expects\
  \ this Center to develop the next generation of applied mathematical, computational,\
  \ and statistical theory (including algorithms and methods), and to advance the\
  \ quantitative analytical capabilities of DHS components and offices and their partners.\
  \ This Center also will provide quantitative and analytical tools to administrators,\
  \ investigators, field operators, and analysts across DHS components.\n\nThe Cross\
  \ Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research and\
  \ develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations  that\
  \ detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards\
  \ that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s people, agriculture, and economy.\
  \  This Center\u2019s research will provide innovations and methods to improve biothreat\
  \ screening and detection, prevention, and support response.  Researchers will seek\
  \ to understand how advances in bioengineering can support the needs of operators\
  \ in the field when confronted with emerging threats, both naturally occurring and\
  \ in situations involving intentional exposures. The Center will also research how\
  \ to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from diagnostics, genetics, sensors,\
  \ and the environment. Today\u2019s analysts, first responders, professionals in\
  \ public and animal health, and operators in the field are confronted with enormous\
  \ amounts of data which, if understood, could assist in improving our ability to\
  \ identify threats earlier and make decisions that save lives and the economy.\n\
  \nThe Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center will provide solutions\
  \ to enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational\
  \ criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal\
  \ use and exploitation of the cyber domain. CINA will develop and conduct research\
  \ and education programs that will help DHS and its partners enhance investigation\
  \ strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border\
  \ criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber\
  \ domain. The Center will provide education and professional development to improve\
  \ the cost-effectiveness of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction and\
  \ prevention. CINA will also develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products, and\
  \ technology-based solutions for agents, officers and investigators to better coordinate\
  \ investigative strategies and operations to predict, avert and prosecute trans-national\
  \ crimes. \n\nThe Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) will conduct\
  \ research and education that will enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to prepare\
  \ and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS and its\
  \ partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect the Nation\u2019\
  s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach, researchers will investigate multiple\
  \ linked industrial sectors, utilities, and public services. These entities collectively\
  \ prove critical to business continuity and community recovery within a specific\
  \ metropolitan area. The place-based approach will allow CIRI to develop solutions\
  \ to enhance preparedness and recovery of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\
  \ systems. Critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether\
  \ physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or\
  \ destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,\
  \ national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n\nThe Coastal Resilience\
  \ Center (CRC) will conduct research and education to enhance the Nation\u2019s\
  \ ability to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic coastal\
  \ natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The Coastal Resilience Center\
  \ also will consider future climate trends and their impacts on coastal resilience.\
  \ Areas of research will include coastal infrastructure resilience, building resilient\
  \ communities, and disaster dynamics. The overarching goal of the Center will be\
  \ to advance our understanding of coastal hazards to benefit a large number of public\
  \ and private entities. DHS anticipates this research will produce tangible research\
  \ and education results for use by DHS, other federal agencies, state and local\
  \ governments, and other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize\
  \ the Threat RealitY (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting transportation\
  \ environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration across public\
  \ and private entities, and producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded\
  \ spaces with novel design concepts. There are growing threats from malicious threat\
  \ actors that target unsecure spaces where they can inflict the gravest injury to\
  \ human life and property. These threats result in physical, psychological, and\
  \ financial losses on the individual, collective and societal level to the American\
  \ population. To address these threats, DHS can make a difference by ensuring future\
  \ public and private investment in urban infrastructure includes security principals.\
  \ DHS seeks research that will ensure the Departments long-term needs are considered\
  \ when infrastructure recapitalization occurs. SENTRY's research will directly support\
  \ the department\u2019s strategic framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence.\
  \ The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional\
  \ methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.\n\nThe Maritime\
  \ Security Center (MSC) will continue ongoing research and education activities\
  \ in coordination with U.S. Coast Guard and other customers to facilitate transition\
  \ of appropriate projects to DHS components and advance integrated education efforts.\
  \ MSC research projects focus on the following areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis,\
  \ and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology\
  \ Research; and Integration of Science and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance\
  \ and Policy Research. In addition to pursuing key research and education initiatives\
  \ based on DHS challenges, the Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge,\
  \ technical skills, and leadership capabilities of the Nation\u2019s current and\
  \ prospective maritime security workforce. At the core of the Center\u2019s mission\
  \ is the transfer of its research and expertise into relevant, innovative educational\
  \ programs. The Center\u2019s educational programs leverage the subject matter expertise\
  \ and research assets of its academic partners and stakeholder network to provide\
  \ multidisciplinary and experiential learning opportunities for students and tailored\
  \ programs for professional audiences.\n\nThe National Counterterrorism Innovation,\
  \ Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center will conduct research and develop solutions,\
  \ protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations that detect, assess, and\
  \ respond to domestic terrorist activities that would harm the people and infrastructure\
  \ of the United States. The Center\u2019s research portfolio will focus on four\
  \ major theme areas: the nature of counterterrorism operations, development of the\
  \ Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, Terrorism Prevention, and\
  \ Workforce Development. The Center will provide education and professional development\
  \ to ensure that the current and future homeland security enterprise workforce is\
  \ adequately trained and educated to prepare for and respond to terrorist activities."

    COE in FY22.  ADAC - completed the development of an Arctic Ice Condition Index
    (ARCTICE) and its integration into a visualization tool for the Arctic region,
    initially focused on the ice laden waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort
    Seas.  ARCTICE produces an easy-to-understand numeral to communicate ice conditions
    that are relevant to the capabilities of an individual vessel.  This index has
    the potential to provide our U.S. Coast Guard and shipmasters with vital data
    to ensure the safety and security of Arctic vessels, personnel, and our environment.  CAOE
    - hosted its third Hackathon/Design Challenge on "Countering Emerging Threats
    o Critical Infrastructure."  This multi-COE event included 73 undergraduate and
    graduate students and 17 individual teams.  The event provided a structured learning
    experience for students and included several real-world problem statements impacting
    homeland security, in which they were given them the opportunity to design, build,
    and implement innovative solutions that were then presented to SMEs and DHS leadership.  CBTS
    - CBP Officers and Agricultural Specialists successfully completed the Epidemiology
    102 train-the trainer course.  CBTS partnered with AgriLife Research at Texas
    A&M University to develop the Epidemiology 102 course to train DHS Customs and
    Border Protection (CBP) Officers, Agriculture Specialists and other CBP field
    personnel to effectively query and triage incoming travelers, cargo, and shipments
    at our borders and ports of entry, and address epidemiological considerations.  CINA
