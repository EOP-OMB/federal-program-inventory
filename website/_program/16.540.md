- description: "Funded sites are required to report on existing performance metrics\
    \ specifically developed for the 32 purpose areas under the Formula Grants program\
    \ (see https://ojjdppmt.ojp.gov/help/titleIIdocs.html). The latest available performance\
    \ measures data indicate that nearly 88,935 at-risk youth were directly served\

    \ completed the defined program requirements successfully.\n•\t67 percent of youth\
    \ improved in a behavior area in the short term. The most commonly addressed behavior\
    \ issue was social competence, with 91 percent of targeted youth exhibiting a\
    \ behavior change. In addition, 93 percent of targeted youth exhibited a change\
    \ in antisocial behavior and 53 percent of targeted youth exhibited a behavior\
    \ change in school attendance.\n•\tOf program youth tracked, 28 percent had an\
    \ arrest or delinquent offense, and seven percent reoffended with a new arrest\
