  of government, and federal recognized tribes to implement programs and strategies
  to prevent and intervene youth gang related violence.


  To prevent, intervene, and reduce the participation of juveniles in the activities
  of gangs that commit crimes.  Such programs and activities may include:  1) individual,
  peer, family, and group counseling, including provision of life skills training
  and preparation for living independently, which shall include cooperation with social
  services, welfare, and health care programs; 2) education and social services designed
  to address the social and developmental needs of juveniles; 3) crisis intervention
  and counseling to juveniles, who are particularly at risk of gang involvement, and
  their families; 4) the organization of the neighborhood and community groups to
  work closely with parents, schools, law enforcement, and other public and private
  agencies in the community; 5) supporting the coordination of existing comprehensive
  community-based anti-gang initiatives; and 6) training and assistance to adults
  who have significant relationships with juveniles who are or may become members
  of gangs, to assist such adults in providing constructive alternatives to participating
  in the activities of gangs.  To develop within the juvenile adjudicatory and correctional
  systems new and innovative means to address the problems of juveniles convicted
  of serious drug-related and gang-related offenses.  To provide treatment to juveniles
  who are members of such gangs, including members who are accused of committing a
  serious crime and members who have been adjudicated as being delinquent.  To promote
  the involvement of juveniles in lawful activities in geographical areas in which
  gangs commit crimes.  To promote and support, with the cooperation of community-based
  organizations experienced in providing services to juveniles engaged in gang-related
  activities and cooperation of local law enforcement agencies, the development of
  policies and activities in public elementary and secondary schools which will assist
  such schools in maintaining a safe environment conducive to learning.  To assist
  juveniles who are or may become members of gangs to obtain appropriate educational
  instruction, in or outside a regular school program, including the provision of
  counseling and other services to promote and support the continued participation
  of such juveniles in such instructional programs.  To expand the availability of
  prevention and treatment services relating to the illegal use of controlled substances
  and controlled substances analogues (as defined in paragraphs (6) and (32) of section
  102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802) by juveniles, provided through
  State and local health and social services agencies.  To provide services to prevent
  juveniles from coming into contact with the juvenile justice system again as a result
  of gang- related activity.  To provide services at a special location in a school
  or housing project.  To facilitate coordination and cooperation among: 1) local
  education, juvenile justice, employment, law enforcement, and social service agencies;

  services to juvenile gang members for the purpose of reducing the participation
  of juveniles in illegal gang activities.
