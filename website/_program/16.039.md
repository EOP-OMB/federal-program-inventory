objective: "The Rural Violent Crime Initiative seeks to award grants on a competitive\
  \ basis to small law enforcement agencies and prosecutors\u2019 offices in rural\
  \ locations. These grants will support improved training and technology, expanded\
  \ community-based crime prevention programs, and partnerships with victim services\
  \ providers. This initiative is intended to improve communication and collaboration\
  \ between state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies and the communities\
  \ they serve in order to address the unique criminal justice challenges in rural\
  \ areas.\n\nGoal:  The goal of this program is to assist and support local rural\
  \ law enforcement agencies and/or prosecutors\u2019 offices as they plan, implement,\
  \ and assess identified violent crime problems in their jurisdiction.  Training\
  \ and technical assistance (TTA) will be made available to site-based awardees to\
  \ assist them in achieving these goals. The TTA provider will work with BJA to coordinate\
  \ assistance and will compile a final report which includes an assessment of individual\
  \ site efforts, overarching findings, and lessons learned.\n\nThe objectives are\
  \ as follows:\n\u2022\tAssist rural jurisdictions in reducing their violent crime\
  \ problems. \n\u2022\tIdentify strategies that will be designed and targeted to\
  \ the unique characteristics of violent crime occurring in rural jurisdictions.\
  \ \n\u2022\tContribute to the professional literature and research on rural violent\
  \ crime.\n\u2022\tDevelop evidence-based resources to support intervention strategies\
  \ that address rural violence.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of rural jurisdictions\
  \ that have received funds; and,\n\nPerformance Measure 2:  Percentage of rural\
  \ grantees that experienced a reduction in their rural violence problem (at the\
  \ closeout of their award)."
