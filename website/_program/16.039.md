objective: "The goal of Rural Violent Crime Reduction Initiative (RVCRI) program is\
  \ to assist and support rural law enforcement agencies and/or prosecutors’ offices\
  \ as they plan, implement, and assess identified violent crime problems in their\
  \ jurisdiction. \n\nThe RVCRI awards grants on a competitive basis to law enforcement\
  \ agencies and prosecutors’ offices in rural locations. These grants will support\
  \ improved training and technology, expanded community-based crime prevention programs,\
  \ and partnerships with victim services providers. This initiative is intended to\
  \ improve communication and collaboration between law enforcement agencies and the\
  \ communities they serve to address unique crime challenges in rural areas.\n\n\
  Training and technical assistance (TTA) will be made available to site-based awardees\
  \ to assist them in achieving these goals. The TTA provider will work with BJA to\
  \ coordinate assistance and will compile a final report which includes an assessment\
  \ of individual site efforts, overarching findings, and lessons learned.\n\nAll\
  \ agencies receiving funding through this program must engage with the selected\
  \ BJA Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) Provider throughout the duration of\
  \ the grant. The TTA is free of charge to the grantee and is intended to provide\
  \ support troubleshooting any challenges that emerge related to successful implementation\
  \ of grant activities.  \n\nThe objectives are as follows:\n•\tAssist rural jurisdictions\
  \ in reducing their violent crime problems. \n•\tIdentify and design strategies\
  \ to target the unique characteristics of violent crime occurring in rural jurisdictions.\
  \ \n•\tContribute to the professional literature and research on rural violent crime.\n\
  •\tDevelop resources to support strategies that address violent crime challenges.\n\
  \nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of rural jurisdictions that have received funds;\
  \ and,\n\nPerformance Measure 2:  Percentage of rural grantees that experienced\
  \ a reduction in their rural violence problem (at the closeout of their award)."

- description: "A rural Police Department hired a detective to enhance investigative\
    \ capacity with a focus on narcotics-related crime. In 2023, the agency conducted\
    \ over 35 narcotics-related seizures involving fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, and\
    \ methamphetamine, resulting in over 3,200 grams of illicit substances being recovered.\
    \ In one large multi-agency interdiction in December 2023, 71 illegal firearms,\
    \ 22 suppressors, and 1,350 lbs of ammunition were seized. Through this work,\
    \ the agency has collaborated with eight agencies on investigations, including\
    \ a 50-person interdiction with the neighboring jurisdictions. \n\n \n\n A rural\
    \ Sheriff’s Office, through the RVCRI, employed data analysis technology and used\
    \ its PenLink software to identify the supply source in a multistate-wide fentanyl\
    \ and cocaine investigation, which resulted in an arrest and the seizure of 20\
    \ grams of cocaine, 12 grams of fentanyl, and over $16,000 in cash. The county\
    \ continues to use the software to aid and assist in addressing narcotics-related\
    \ crime in the county and region. The collection of crime data provides an advanced\
    \ means of conducting proactive policing. \n\n \n\nA rural Police Department,\
    \ through the RVCRI, implemented an Automated License Plate Reader program. Since\
    \ installation, ALPRs have been instrumental in two gang-related shooting cases,\
    \ two narcotics trafficking cases, and one homicide. \n\n \n\nA rural District\
    \ Attorney’s Office, through the Rural Violent Crime Reduction Initiative, has\
    \ expanded forensic evidence extraction technology to support multiple counties\
    \ in its region. In 2023, the agency acquired thousands of gigabytes of data,\
    \ including over 1,000 GB related to crimes against children (CAC) cases and over\
    \ 1,700 GB for narcotics-related crimes."
