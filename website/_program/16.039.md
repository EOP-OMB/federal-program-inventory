objective: "The Rural Violent Crime Initiative seeks to award grants on a competitive\
  \ basis to small law enforcement agencies and prosecutors’ offices in rural locations.\
  \ These grants will support improved training and technology, expanded community-based\
  \ crime prevention programs, and partnerships with victim services providers. This\
  \ initiative is intended to improve communication and collaboration between state,\
  \ local, and tribal law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve in order\
  \ to address the unique criminal justice challenges in rural areas.\n\nGoal:  The\
  \ goal of this program is to assist and support local rural law enforcement agencies\
  \ and/or prosecutors’ offices as they plan, implement, and assess identified violent\
  \ crime problems in their jurisdiction.  Training and technical assistance (TTA)\
  \ will be made available to site-based awardees to assist them in achieving these\
  \ goals. The TTA provider will work with BJA to coordinate assistance and will compile\
  \ a final report which includes an assessment of individual site efforts, overarching\
  \ findings, and lessons learned.\n\nThe objectives are as follows:\n•\tAssist rural\
  \ jurisdictions in reducing their violent crime problems. \n•\tIdentify strategies\
  \ that will be designed and targeted to the unique characteristics of violent crime\
  \ occurring in rural jurisdictions. \n•\tContribute to the professional literature\
  \ and research on rural violent crime.\n•\tDevelop evidence-based resources to support\
  \ intervention strategies that address rural violence.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:\
  \  Number of rural jurisdictions that have received funds; and,\n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 2:  Percentage of rural grantees that experienced a reduction in their rural violence\
  \ problem (at the closeout of their award)."
