objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments or industries. Instead, it would generally seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an income
  tax credit for the production of qualifying transportation fuel with zero or low
  greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of the credit is calculated from the base amount,
  or alternate amount, of the credit and the emissions factor of a transportation
  fuel, with a special rate for sustainable aviation fuel. Producers are eligible
  for larger credits as the emission of the fuels they produce approach zero. The
  credit applies to fuel produced after December 31, 2024 and sold on or before December
  31, 2027. A sustainable aviation fuel-specific credit is available for fuel produced
  after December 31, 2022 and before January 1, 2025.
