objective: "The EPA's Geographic Programs - Chesapeake Bay Program (referred to as\
  \ Chesapeake Bay Program) awards competitive grants to states, tribal and local\
  \ governments, non-governmental organizations, interstate agencies and academic\
  \ institutions to reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources\
  \ in the Chesapeake Bay. Grants are awarded for implementation projects, as well\
  \ as for technical assistance, monitoring, environmental education, and other related\
  \ activities. EPA's funding priority is to achieve the goals and objectives established\
  \ in the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement through the implementation of the\
  \ management strategies. More detail on these can be found at http://www.chesapeakeprogress.com.\
  \ The competitive assistance agreements under this program include: 1) Small Watershed\
  \ Grants (SWG): This EPA program component supports local governments and non-governmental\
  \ organizations working to protect and improve local waters and habitats across\
  \ the Bay watershed while building citizen-based resource stewardship. 2) Innovative\
  \ Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Grants (INSR): This program component supports\
  \ regional innovative solutions to reduce or eliminate nutrient and sediment pollution\
  \ to the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 3) Technical Assistance and General\
  \ Assistance Grants: This program component supports nonprofit organizations, state,\
  \ tribal and local governments, academic institutions, and others to implement the\
  \ goals of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Funding Priorities - Fiscal\
  \ Year 2023: Work in this program directly supports Goal 5/Objective 5.2, Protect\
  \ and Restore Waterbodies and Watersheds in EPA's FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan.\
  \ Most of EPA\u2019s direct efforts for FY 2023 will focus on supporting implementation\
  \ of the two-year Logic & Action Plans for the 25 Management Strategies developed\
  \ under the Agreement, with particular focus on accelerating implementation of outcomes\
  \ where progress is lagging. In addition, the program is increasing focus on environmental\
  \ justice ensuring the benefits of the Chesapeake Bay Program are distributed equitably,\
  \ as well as increasing efforts in the climate change space by focusing initiatives\
  \ on the resiliency of the watershed. Specific emphases include: Implementation\
  \ of the water quality outcomes that describe the commitment of the Agreement signatories\
  \ for having all practices in place by 2025 to achieve the necessary pollutant reductions;\
  \ Accelerating implementation of outcomes that help keep the watershed resilient\
  \ in the face of climate change (including forest and wetland protection and restoration);\
  \ Ensuring the most up-to-date science is used throughout the Chesapeake Bay Program\
  \ to support decision-making, implementation, and future condition assessment. For\
  \ example, improving computer models to help predict the impact of climate change\
  \ on the Chesapeake Bay Program\u2019s ability to meet water quality standards in\
  \ the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay; and implementing an action plan to improve\
  \ diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in Chesapeake Bay Program restoration\
  \ efforts."
