objective: 'The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and unique as North America''s
  largest and most biologically diverse estuary. The objective of the Chesapeake Bay
  Program’s assistance agreements is to fund activities that support achievement of
  the goals and outcomes of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Funding priorities
  include, but are not limited to, implementation projects that support water quality
  improvement and environmental stewardship, coordination of the Chesapeake Bay Program
  partnership, monitoring of water quality and living resources of the Chesapeake
  Bay, and advancement of data science that helps inform decision-making. EPA supports
  advancement of these priorities by funding cooperative agreements for the following
  grant programs: 1) Technical and general assistance grants, which support the partnership
  in carrying out the watershed agreement; 2) Small Watershed Grants (SWG), which
  support protection and improvement of local waterways while building citizen-based
  resource stewardship; and 3) Innovative Nutrient and Sediment Reduction (INSR) grants,
  which support regional innovative solutions to reduce or eliminate nutrient and
  sediment pollution. Ensuring that the Program’s benefits are distributed equitably
  and increasing climate resiliency are special areas of focus for the partnership.
