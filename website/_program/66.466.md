objective: "The EPA's Geographic Programs - Chesapeake Bay Program (referred to as\
  \ Chesapeake Bay Program) awards competitive grants to states, tribal and local\
  \ governments, non-governmental organizations, interstate agencies and academic\
  \ institutions to reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources\
  \ in the Chesapeake Bay. Grants are awarded for implementation projects, as well\
  \ as for technical assistance, monitoring, environmental education, and other related\
  \ activities. EPA's funding priority is to achieve the goals and objectives established\
  \ in the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement through the implementation of the\
  \ management strategies. More detail on these can be found at http://www.chesapeakeprogress.com.\
  \ The competitive assistance agreements under this program include: 1) Small Watershed\
  \ Grants (SWG): This EPA program component supports local governments and non-governmental\
  \ organizations working to protect and improve local waters and habitats across\
  \ the Bay watershed while building citizen-based resource stewardship. 2) Innovative\
  \ Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Grants (INSR): This program component supports\
  \ regional innovative solutions to reduce or eliminate nutrient and sediment pollution\
  \ to the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 3) Technical Assistance and General\
  \ Assistance Grants: This program component supports nonprofit organizations, state,\
  \ tribal and local governments, academic institutions, and others to implement the\
  \ goals of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Funding Priorities - Fiscal\
  \ Year 2023: Work in this program directly supports Goal 5/Objective 5.2, Protect\
  \ and Restore Waterbodies and Watersheds in EPA's FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan.\
  \ Most of EPA\u2019s direct efforts for FY 2023 will focus on supporting implementation\
  \ of the two-year Logic & Action Plans for the 25 Management Strategies developed\
  \ under the Agreement, with particular focus on accelerating implementation of outcomes\
  \ where progress is lagging. In addition, the program is increasing focus on environmental\
  \ justice ensuring the benefits of the Chesapeake Bay Program are distributed equitably,\
  \ as well as increasing efforts in the climate change space by focusing initiatives\
  \ on the resiliency of the watershed. Specific emphases include: Implementation\
  \ of the water quality outcomes that describe the commitment of the Agreement signatories\
  \ for having all practices in place by 2025 to achieve the necessary pollutant reductions;\
  \ Accelerating implementation of outcomes that help keep the watershed resilient\
  \ in the face of climate change (including forest and wetland protection and restoration);\
  \ Ensuring the most up-to-date science is used throughout the Chesapeake Bay Program\
  \ to support decision-making, implementation, and future condition assessment. For\
  \ example, improving computer models to help predict the impact of climate change\
  \ on the Chesapeake Bay Program\u2019s ability to meet water quality standards in\
  \ the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay; and implementing an action plan to improve\
  \ diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in Chesapeake Bay Program restoration\
  \ efforts."

results:
- description: In FY 2023, it is projected that 13 RFAs will be released for up to
    16 awards. EPA plans to continue to provide the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership
    with funding and technical assistance, track and report progress, and coordinate
    and facilitate partnership efforts to reach our mutual goals of a healthy Bay
    and watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Program is continuing to reaffirm its commitment
    to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice and will ensure the benefits of our
    science, restoration, and partnership programs are distributed equitably without
    disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. Additionally, EPA will work
    to further integrate climate change in Bay restoration efforts. EPA and the partnership
    are actively investigating Best Management Practices to better protect the watershed
    and tidal Bay against the observed increased precipitation volumes and intensity
    brought about by climate change in urban/developed and agricultural regions.
