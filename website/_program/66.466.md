objective: 'The EPA''s Geographic Programs - Chesapeake Bay Program (referred to as
  Chesapeake Bay Program) awards competitive grants to states, tribal and local governments,
  non-governmental organizations, interstate agencies and academic institutions to
  reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources in the Chesapeake
  Bay. Grants are awarded for implementation projects, as well as for technical assistance,
  monitoring, environmental education, and other related activities. EPA''s funding
  priority is to achieve the goals and objectives established in the 2014 Chesapeake
  Bay Watershed Agreement through the implementation of the management strategies.
  More detail on these can be found at http://www.chesapeakeprogress.com. The competitive
  assistance agreements under this program include: 1) Small Watershed Grants (SWG):
  This EPA program component supports local governments and non-governmental organizations
  working to protect and improve local waters and habitats across the Bay watershed
  while building citizen-based resource stewardship. 2) Innovative Nutrient and Sediment
  Reduction Grants (INSR): This program component supports regional innovative solutions
  to reduce or eliminate nutrient and sediment pollution to the Chesapeake Bay and
  its tributaries. 3) Technical Assistance and General Assistance Grants: This program
  component supports nonprofit organizations, state, tribal and local governments,
  academic institutions, and others to implement the goals of the 2014 Chesapeake
  Bay Watershed Agreement. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Work in this program
  directly supports Goal 5/Objective 5.2, Protect and Restore Waterbodies and Watersheds
  in EPA''s FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan. Most of EPA’s direct efforts for FY 2023
  will focus on supporting implementation of the two-year Logic & Action Plans for
  the 25 Management Strategies developed under the Agreement, with particular focus
  on accelerating implementation of outcomes where progress is lagging. In addition,
  the program is increasing focus on environmental justice ensuring the benefits of
  the Chesapeake Bay Program are distributed equitably, as well as increasing efforts
  in the climate change space by focusing initiatives on the resiliency of the watershed.
  Specific emphases include: Implementation of the water quality outcomes that describe
  the commitment of the Agreement signatories for having all practices in place by
  2025 to achieve the necessary pollutant reductions; Accelerating implementation
  of outcomes that help keep the watershed resilient in the face of climate change
  (including forest and wetland protection and restoration); Ensuring the most up-to-date
  science is used throughout the Chesapeake Bay Program to support decision-making,
  implementation, and future condition assessment. For example, improving computer
  models to help predict the impact of climate change on the Chesapeake Bay Program’s
  ability to meet water quality standards in the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay;
  and implementing an action plan to improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice
  in Chesapeake Bay Program restoration efforts.'

- description: In FY 2023, it is projected that 13 RFAs will be released for up to
    16 awards. EPA plans to continue to provide the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership
    with funding and technical assistance, track and report progress, and coordinate
    and facilitate partnership efforts to reach our mutual goals of a healthy Bay
    and watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Program is continuing to reaffirm its commitment
    to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice and will ensure the benefits of our
    science, restoration, and partnership programs are distributed equitably without
    disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. Additionally, EPA will work
    to further integrate climate change in Bay restoration efforts. EPA and the partnership
    are actively investigating Best Management Practices to better protect the watershed
    and tidal Bay against the observed increased precipitation volumes and intensity
    brought about by climate change in urban/developed and agricultural regions.
