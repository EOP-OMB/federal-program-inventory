objective: The goals of the SF Bay Restoration Program (formally SF Bay Grant Program)
  are to improve water quality and restore aquatic habitat (i.e., wetlands) in the
  San Francisco Bay and its watersheds. Funded projects will reduce polluted run-off,
  restore impaired waters and enhance aquatic habitat. Over the next five years the
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also referred to as the Bipartisan
  Infrastructure Law (BIL), aims to broaden the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
  (EPA) reach and focus under the San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund
  (SFBWQIF). The BIL specifically expands the SFBWQIF to focus on inequities in the
  access to Federal funding and implementation of projects and climate resilience
  in underserved communities. It provides additional funding to advance the Biden
  Administration’s goal of investing in America’s infrastructure and delivering environmental
  and public health benefits for communities with environmental justice (EJ) concerns.
