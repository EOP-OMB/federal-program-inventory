objective: The goals of the SF Bay grant program are to improve water quality and
  restore aquatic habitat (i.e., wetlands) in the San Francisco Bay and its watersheds.
  Funded projects will reduce polluted run-off, restore impaired waters and enhance
  aquatic habitat. Over the next five years the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
  Act (IIJA), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), aims to
  broaden the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) reach and focus under the
  San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund (SFBWQIF). The BIL specifically
  expands the SFBWQIF to focus on inequities in the access to Federal funding and
  implementation of projects and climate resilience in underserved communities. It
  provides additional funding to advance the Biden Administration’s goal of investing
  in America’s infrastructure and delivering environmental and public health benefits
  for communities with environmental justice (EJ) concerns.
