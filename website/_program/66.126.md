objective: "The goals of the SF Bay grant program are to improve water quality and\
  \ restore aquatic habitat (i.e., wetlands) in the San Francisco Bay and its watersheds.\
  \ Funded projects will reduce polluted run-off, restore impaired waters and enhance\
  \ aquatic habitat. Over the next five years the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs\
  \ Act (IIJA), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), aims\
  \ to broaden the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) reach and focus\
  \ under the San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund (SFBWQIF). The BIL\
  \ specifically expands the SFBWQIF to focus on inequities in the access to Federal\
  \ funding and implementation of projects and climate resilience in underserved communities.\
  \ It provides additional funding to advance the Biden Administration\u2019s goal\
  \ of investing in America\u2019s infrastructure and delivering environmental and\
  \ public health benefits for communities with environmental justice (EJ) concerns."
