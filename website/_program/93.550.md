objective: 'The primary goal of the Transitional Living Program (TLP) and Maternity
  Group Home (MGH) Program is to help runaway and homeless youth and/or pregnant or
  parenting runaway and homeless youth between the ages of 16 to under 22 establish
  sustainable living and well-being for themselves and if applicable, their dependent
  child(ren). Through the provision of residential stay up to 540 days (and in exceptional
  circumstances 635 days) and comprehensive supportive services, youth between the
  ages of 16 to under 22 enrolled in TLPs or MGHs  will realize improvements in four
  core outcome areas: social and emotional well-being, permanent connections, education
  or employment, safe and stable housing.


  MGH services include, but are not limited to, parenting skills, child development,
  family budgeting, and health and nutrition education, in addition to the required
  services provided under the  TLP.'
