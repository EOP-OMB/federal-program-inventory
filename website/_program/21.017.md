objective: "The purposes of this program are the following: \n(1) To improve the lives\
  \ of families and individuals in need in the United States by funding social programs\
  \ that achieve real results. \n2) To redirect funds away from programs that, based\
  \ on objective data, are ineffective, and into programs that achieve demonstrable,\
  \ measurable results. \n(3) To ensure Federal funds are used effectively on social\
  \ services to produce positive outcomes for both service recipients and taxpayers.\
  \ \n(4) To establish the use of social impact partnerships to address some of our\
  \ Nation’s most pressing problems. \n(5) To facilitate the creation of public-private\
  \ partnerships that bundle philanthropic or other private resources with existing\
  \ public spending to scale up effective social interventions already being implemented\
  \ by private organizations, nonprofits, charitable organizations, and State and\
  \ local governments across the country. \n(6) To bring pay-for-performance to the\
  \ social sector, allowing the United States to improve the impact and effectiveness\
  \ of vital social services programs while redirecting inefficient or duplicative\
  \ spending. \n(7) To incorporate outcomes measurement and randomized controlled\
  \ trials or other rigorous methodologies for assessing program impact."
