objective: 'The purposes of this program are the following:

  (1)  To improve the lives of families and individuals in need in the United States
  by funding social programs that achieve real results.

  (2)  To redirect funds away from programs that, based on objective data, are ineffective,
  and into programs that achieve demonstrable, measurable results.

  (3)  To ensure Federal funds are used effectively on social services to produce
  positive outcomes for both service recipients and taxpayers.

  (4)  To establish the use of social impact partnerships to address some of our Nation’s
  most pressing problems.

  (5)  To facilitate the creation of public-private partnerships that bundle philanthropic
  or other private resources with existing public spending to scale up effective social
  interventions already being implemented by private organizations, nonprofits, charitable
  organizations, and State and local governments across the country.

  (6)  To bring pay-for-performance to the social sector, allowing the United States
  to improve the impact and effectiveness of vital social services programs while
  redirecting inefficient or duplicative spending.

  (7)  To incorporate outcomes measurement and randomized controlled trials or other
  rigorous methodologies for assessing program impact.'
