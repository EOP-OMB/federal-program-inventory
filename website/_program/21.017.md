  \ of families and individuals in need in the United States by funding social programs\

  \ measurable results.\n(3)  To ensure Federal funds are used effectively on social\
  \ services to produce positive outcomes for both service recipients and taxpayers.\n\
  (4)  To establish the use of social impact partnerships to address some of our Nation\u2019\
  s most pressing problems.\n(5)  To facilitate the creation of public-private partnerships\
  \ that bundle philanthropic or other private resources with existing public spending\
  \ to scale up effective social interventions already being implemented by private\
  \ organizations, nonprofits, charitable organizations, and State and local governments\
  \ across the country.\n(6)  To bring pay-for-performance to the social sector, allowing\
  \ the United States to improve the impact and effectiveness of vital social services\
  \ programs while redirecting inefficient or duplicative spending.\n(7)  To incorporate\
  \ outcomes measurement and randomized controlled trials or other rigorous methodologies\
