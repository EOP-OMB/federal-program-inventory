objective: The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the decline in the
  economic value of an investment over time. Under current law, however, most nonfuel
  mineral extractors may use percentage depletion (whereby the deduction is fixed
  as a percentage of receipts) rather than cost depletion, with percentage depletion
  rates ranging from 22 percent for sulfur to 5 percent for sand and gravel. Over
  the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of
  the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion may provide more advantageous
  tax treatment than would cost depletion, which limits deductions to an investmentâ€™s
  cost.
