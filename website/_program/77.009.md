objective: The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory
  mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information
  for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating
  regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops
  technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares

  designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission
  direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.
