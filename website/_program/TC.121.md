objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides small businesses
  (less than $1 million in gross receipts or fewer than 31 full-time employees) a
  50 percent credit for expenditures in excess of $250 to remove access barriers for
  disabled persons. The credit is limited to $5,000.
