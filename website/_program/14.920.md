objective: This funding will be made available to public housing agencies that operate
  the housing choice voucher program to conduct lead hazard screenings or lead-risk
  assessments during housing quality standards inspections of pre-1978 units in which
  a family with a voucher resides or expects to reside, and has or expects to have
  a child under age 6 residing in the unit, to demonstrate whether such a process
  preserves rental housing availability and affordability.
