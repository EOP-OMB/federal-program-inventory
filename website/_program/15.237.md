objective: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Rangeland Management Program administers
  grazing for more than 155 million acres of public land. This includes, but is not
  limited to, such things as inventorying, controlling and managing noxious weeds
  and invasive species; improving rangelands through grazing management, vegetation
  restoration treatments, and grazing management structures; and soil resource management.
  Coordination with land managers and other stakeholders is conducted to complete
  priority soil surveys, ecological site descriptions, and on-the-ground projects
  to improve soil stability and reduce erosion. Appropriate management of rangeland
  and soil resources also support actions and authorizations that include, but is
  not limited to, such things as endangered and special status species recovery, grazing
  of domestic livestock, recreation, forest management, hazardous fuels reduction,
  and post fire rehabilitation. To better support land management decisions regarding
  grazing and other range management treatments, soils management, and invasive species,
  the BLM will place a priority on collecting data through the use of consistent,
  comparable, and common indicators, consistent methods, and an unbiased sampling
  framework which will allow for analyses that are repeatable and comparable across
  a region, and decisions based on science and data that are legally defensible. Land
  health assessments completed at a larger scale will be more efficient and less costly
  over time and provide timely support for decision-making. The Rangeland Management
  program conducts inventories, assessments and evaluations of soil and vegetation
  conditions and land health. Monitoring data is collected and analyzed to ensure
  progress toward meeting land health standards.  Funded projects under this program
  will focus on high priority work such as activities that support maintaining or
  achieving land health and productivity, increasing carbon sequestration, and creating
  resilient landscapes to benefit current and future generations. Infrastructure Investment
