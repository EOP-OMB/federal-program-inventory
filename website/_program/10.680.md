objective: 'Protect and manage non-Federal forest and tree resources from damaging
  forest insects, disease causing agents, and invasive plants; develop/improve forest
  health protection technologies; and monitor the health of our nation''s forests.

  To assist State Foresters, State Agriculture or Plant Regulatory Officials, equivalent
  State officials, or other official representatives, subdivisions of states, agencies,
  institutions (public and private), organizations (profit or nonprofit), and individuals
  on non-Federal lands. Activities include: conducting surveys to detect and assess
  insect, disease, invasive plant and other stressors; monitoring and reporting on
  the health of forests and trees; recommending measures to prevent, retard, slow
  the spread, control, suppress or eradicate incipient, potential, threatening or
  emergency forest and tree pests; planning, organizing, directing, and performing
  such measures; providing technical and scientific information, advice, and related
  assistance; developing applied methods and technology to improve management of forest
  health; providing information on pesticides and their use; promoting implementation
  of appropriate silvicultural or management techniques to improve forest health;
  and taking other actions deemed necessary to accomplish the objectives and purposes
  of the Forest Health Protection program. Assistance to tribal lands held in trust
  by the United States Government is provided directly by the Forest Service, and
  thus are not included in this cooperative program. However, other tribal lands,
  such as Alaska Native Corporation Lands, that are not held in trust are included.'
