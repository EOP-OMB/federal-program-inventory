objective: "This program purpose is referencing unequal socioeconomic conditions and\
  \ unfair opportunity structures have long existed and contribute to poor health\
  \ outcomes in minority and ethnic populations and geographically and economically\
  \ disadvantaged communities. Poverty, inferior housing and health care, and other\
  \ debilitating social conditions are endemic to some communities, including Non-Hispanic\
  \ Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Native American communities.  \nResearch highlights\
  \ the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension, high\
  \ cholesterol, and stroke in these groups. CVD is the leading cause of death in\
  \ the US and stroke is the 5th leading cause with an estimated 1 in 9 health care\
  \ dollars spent treating CVD. Despite significant decreases in CVD rates in the\
  \ last 20 years, NHB continue to have higher CVD mortality rates than Non-Hispanic\
  \ Whites (NHW). In 2019, NHB women and men younger than 65 were 2.0 and 1.3 times\
  \ more likely to experience premature death from CVD than their NHW counterparts.\
  \ In 2020, NHB had the highest heart disease mortality rates at 228.6 per 100,000\
  \ and stroke at 56.8 per 100,000.  \nUncontrolled hypertension is the primary contributor\
  \ to morbidity and mortality rate disparities in CVD between NHB and other racial\
  \ and ethnic groups. In 2019, NHB had more than double the age-adjusted death rates\
  \ (56.7) attributable primarily to hypertension compared to NHW (25.7). \nOf the\
  \ 1 in 2 US adults with hypertension, only 26.1% have controlled blood pressure.\
  \ By age 55, the cumulative incidence of hypertension reaches almost 76% in NHB\
  \ men and women, compared to 54.5% and 40.0% among NHW men and women, respectively.\
  \ Moreover, NHB had a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for hypertension after adjustment\
  \ for other factors, regardless of baseline blood pressure. Among NHB adults who\
  \ did not report a hypertension diagnosis, a larger proportion (28%) were unaware\
  \ of hypertension (BP â‰¥140/90 mm Hg) compared to NHW adults (16%). Despite the similar\
  \ rate of hypertension treatment, only one-third of NHB adults had their blood pressure\
  \ controlled, in contrast to 45.0% of NHW adults. These data clearly indicate that\
  \ NHB bear the greatest burden of CVD among US adults.  \nThe outcomes are as stark\
  \ in other CVD-related illnesses. Although the prevalence of high cholesterol in\
  \ NHB is comparable to or lower than in NHW, racial-ethnic disparities occur at\
  \ every level of diagnosis and management. The disparities present in low screening\
  \ rates, fewer prescriptions, and medication adherence. Unsatisfactory control of\
  \ high cholesterol among NHB stems from the same adverse social conditions that\
  \ hinder the control of hypertension. \nInterventions must include an understanding\
  \ of individual and community factors that influence a healthy diet, losing weight,\
  \ being physically active, and medication adherence to address the disparities and\
  \ inequities. There is a need for equity-focused health system interventions to\
  \ prevent, detect, control, and manage hypertension and high cholesterol. Building\
  \ on lessons from the previous work, this program focuses on comprehensive efforts\
  \ to identify and respond to health care disparities and improve CVD-related outcomes,\
  \ specifically for those with hypertension and high cholesterol. \nPopulations of\
  \ focus for this program are adults aged 18 and older with a hypertension crude\
  \ prevalence of 53% or higher, as shown by data specifically at the census tract\
  \ level.  Emphasis should be placed on achieving impact and reach across geographic\
  \ locations where disparate populations can benefit from the strategies included\
  \ in this program."
