    while maintaining or improving the quality of beneficiaries’ care.. #14087 Executive
    Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Prices for Americans, The Secretary shall,
    consistent with the criteria set out in 42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), consider whether
    to select for testing by the Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery
    models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies
    for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including models
    that may lead to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based
    payment that promotes high-quality care.  The Secretary shall, not later than
    90 days after the date of this order, submit a report to the Assistant to the
    President for Domestic Policy enumerating and describing any models that the Secretary
    has selected.  The report shall also include the Secretary’s plan and timeline
    to test any such models.  Following the submission of the report, the Secretary
    shall take appropriate actions to test any health care payment and delivery models
    discussed in the report.'

objective: "The Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model aims to improve the lives\
  \ of people with Medicaid living with rare and severe diseases by increasing access\
  \ to potentially transformative treatments. Cell and gene therapies have high upfront\
  \ costs but have the potential to reduce health care spending over time by addressing\
  \ the underlying causes of disease, reducing the severity of illness, and reducing\
  \ health care utilization. Initially, the model will focus on access to gene therapy\
  \ treatments for people living with sickle cell disease, a genetic blood disorder\
  \ that disproportionately affects Black Americans.\nThe Notice of Funding Opportunity\
  \ (NOFO) announces the opportunity to apply for Cooperative Agreement funding to\
  \ support states’ participation in the CGT Access Model. The CGT Access Model is\
  \ a voluntary model for states and manufacturers that tests whether a CMS-led approach\
  \ to developing and administering outcomes-based agreements (OBAs) for cell and\
  \ gene therapies improves Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to innovative treatment,\
  \ improves their health outcomes, and reduces health care costs and burdens to state\
  \ Medicaid programs. Within this model, CMS will negotiate standard key terms of\
  \ an OBA directly with manufacturers of gene therapies approved or licensed by the\
  \ U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.\
  \ After the key terms have been disclosed, states: (1) may apply to participate\
  \ in the model in response to the State Request for Applications (RFA); and (2)\
  \ may apply for Cooperative Agreement funding in response to the NOFO. \n•\tCooperative\
  \ Agreement funding is intended to support state model implementation activities\
  \ and to support states that take steps to improve equitable access to gene therapy\
  \ and multi-disciplinary, comprehensive care in conjunction with the model test."
