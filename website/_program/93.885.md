    Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Prices for Americans, The Secretary shall,
    consistent with the criteria set out in 42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), consider whether
    to select for testing by the Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery
    models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies
    for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including models
    that may lead to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based
    payment that promotes high-quality care.  The Secretary shall, not later than
    90 days after the date of this order, submit a report to the Assistant to the
    President for Domestic Policy enumerating and describing any models that the Secretary
    has selected.  The report shall also include the Secretary’s plan and timeline

objective: "The Cell & Gene Therapy Access Model is a voluntary model intended to\
  \ improve the lives of Medicaid beneficiaries living with rare and severe diseases\
  \ by increasing access to cell and gene therapies, which are potentially transformative\
  \ treatments. Cell and gene therapies have high upfront costs but have the potential\
  \ to reduce health care spending over time by addressing the underlying causes of\
  \ disease, reducing the severity of illness, and reducing health care utilization.\
  \ Initially, the Model will focus on access to gene therapy treatments for people\
  \ living with sickle cell disease, a genetic blood disorder that disproportionately\
  \ affects Black Americans.\nUnder the Model, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid\
  \ Services (CMS) will form a partnership between CMS, pharmaceutical manufacturers\
  \ (hereinafter, “Manufacturers”) of CGTs, and States, wherein they agree upon an\
  \ outcomes-based agreement (OBA) that will include discounted prices for the therapies,\
  \ a uniform access policy for all eligible beneficiaries in participating States,\
  \ and rebates to States if the therapies do not perform as expected in the Model\
  \ population. The Model seeks to test whether a CMS-led approach to negotiating\
  \ and administering outcomes-based agreements (OBAs) for CGTs, while addressing\
  \ a broad range of access barriers will improve beneficiary access and health outcomes,\
  \ and reduce health care costs. \nAssistance Listing goals:\n•\tProvide States with\
  \ funding to support Model implementation and optional partnerships with community-based\
  \ organizations.\n•\tProvide States with funding if they achieve milestones associated\
  \ with improving equitable access to gene therapy for SCD and promoting multi-disciplinary,\
  \ comprehensive care that address access barriers."
