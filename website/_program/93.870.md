objective: 'The goals of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program
  (MIECHV Program) are to: (1) strengthen and improve the programs and activities
  carried out under Title V of the Social Security Act; (2) improve coordination of
  services for at-risk communities; and (3) identify and provide comprehensive services
  to improve outcomes for eligible families who reside in at-risk communities. The
  MIECHV Program was created to support voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services
  for at-risk pregnant people and parents with young children up to kindergarten entry.
  The MIECHV Program builds upon decades of scientific research that shows home visits
  conducted by a nurse, social worker, early childhood educator, or other trained
  professional during pregnancy and in the first years of a child’s life improves
  the lives of children and families. Home visiting helps prevent child abuse and
  neglect, supports positive parenting, improves maternal and child health, and promotes
  child development and school readiness. The investment provides coordinated and
  comprehensive high-quality voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services with
  a national reach. The MIECHV Program plays a crucial role in building high-quality,
  comprehensive statewide early childhood systems to support pregnant people, parents
  and caregivers, and children from birth to kindergarten entry and ultimately, to
  improve health and development outcomes.'
