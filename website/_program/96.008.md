objective: To comply with the Ticket-to-Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA)
  which was passed in December 1999, and reauthorized by the Social Security Protection
  Act of 2004, which requires the SSA to establish a community-based work incentives
  planning and assistance program. The purpose of the program is to support beneficiaries
  who want to return to work to make a successful and profitable transition to the
  workforce.  Beneficiaries that continue to work improve their economic independence
  and financial security.  WIPA projects help beneficiaries take advantage of our
  work incentives programs, which may delay or reduce the effect of work on monetary
  benefits and health insurance.  Additionally, WIPA projects act as repositories
  for information about other work incentives, benefits counseling services, and other
  resources that may help beneficiaries succeed in their work attempts, or may assist
  beneficiaries to improve financial stability as they return to work.
