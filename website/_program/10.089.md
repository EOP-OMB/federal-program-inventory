objective: 'The objective of LFP is to provide financial assistance from the Agricultural
  Disaster Relief Trust Fund (Trust Fund).  The Secretary of Agriculture (henceforth
  the Secretary) has the authority to use sums from the Trust Fund to provide compensation
  to livestock producers who suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire.  For
  drought, the losses must have occurred because of a qualifying drought during the
  normal grazing period for the county on land that is native or improved pastureland
  with permanent vegetative cover or is planted to a crop planted specifically for
  grazing covered livestock.  For fire, LFP provides payments to eligible livestock
  producers that have suffered grazing losses on range land managed by a Federal agency
  if the eligible livestock producer is prohibited by the Federal agency from grazing
  the normal permitted livestock on the managed range land because of a qualifying
  fire.  Eligible grazing losses must have occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and
  before October 1, 2011.  The eligible grazing losses must occur within the same
  calendar year for which benefits are being requested.


  ATRA provides extending benefits to livestock producers for grazing losses due to
  drought and wildfires on Federal lands through September 30, 2013, subject to appropriations.
