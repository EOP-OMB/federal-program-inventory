objective: "The EPA South Florida Program provides competitive grants to address the\
  \ immediate and emerging ecological pressures and threats to south Florida waters\
  \ including fresh waters, estuaries, bays, and coral reef, central to South Florida\u2019\
  s economic and ecological wellbeing. Aquatic ecosystems play a vital role supporting\
  \ healthy and resilient estuaries, coastal, inland, and near-shore infrastructure\
  \ by providing food, habitat, nutrient removal, water filtration, storm attenuation,\
  \ carbon storage, shoreline stabilization, and other financial and tangible benefits.\
  \ This assistance listing is for the South Florida Program region that includes\
  \ the 16-county area covered by South Florida Water Management District as well\
  \ as the Florida Keys, Florida Reef Tract, Caloosahatchee Estuary, Indian River\
  \ Lagoon, St. Lucie Estuary, Florida Bay, and Biscayne Bay. The South Florida Program\
  \ competitive grant program is supported by the 2023 Congressional explanation statement\
  \ which provides the following: \u201CThe agreements provide $8,000,000 for the\
  \ South Florida program. Within the funds provided, the Committees recommend at\
  \ least $2,000,000 to monitor coral health in South Florida; $1,150,000 to enhance\
  \ water quality and seagrass monitoring in Caloosahatchee Estuary and Indian River\
  \ Lagoon, especially with respect to assessing the impact to Lake Okeechobee discharges\
  \ and harmful algal blooms; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and seagrass monitoring\
  \ in Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay, especially with respect to assessing the impact\
  \ of Everglades Restoration projects and harmful algal blooms; and $1,000,000 for\
  \ the expansion of water quality and ecosystem health monitoring and prediction\
  \ network which will use vetted, modern procedures for long-term monitoring of Florida\
  \ waters, including Molecular, Algal, Ocean Floor, and Seagrasses.\u201D Implementation\
  \ of IIJA funding opportunities prioritizes funding for communities which are underserved\
  \ and overburdened. These communities tend to be disproportionally at risk from\
  \ climate change impacts, water quality issues, and lack educational opportunities.\
  \ The EPA recognizes the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate stress\
  \ on communities with environmental justice concerns. The agency will prioritize\
  \ partners protecting and restoring water quality using new or innovative approaches,\
  \ methods, or technologies with green infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and\
  \ resilient infrastructure less vulnerable to flooding and the effects of the changing\
  \ climate in low-income and underserved communities."
