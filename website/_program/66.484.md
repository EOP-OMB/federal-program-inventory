objective: 'The EPA South Florida Program provides competitive grants to address the
  immediate and emerging ecological pressures and threats to south Florida waters
  including fresh waters, estuaries, bays, and coral reef, central to South Florida’s
  economic and ecological wellbeing. Aquatic ecosystems play a vital role supporting
  healthy and resilient estuaries, coastal, inland, and near-shore infrastructure
  by providing food, habitat, nutrient removal, water filtration, storm attenuation,
  carbon storage, shoreline stabilization, and other financial and tangible benefits.
  This assistance listing is for the South Florida Program region that includes the
  16-county area covered by South Florida Water Management District as well as the
  Florida Keys, Florida Reef Tract, Caloosahatchee Estuary, Indian River Lagoon, St.
  Lucie Estuary, Florida Bay, and Biscayne Bay. The South Florida Program competitive
  grant program is supported by the 2023 Congressional explanation statement which
  provides the following: “The agreements provide $8,000,000 for the South Florida
  program. Within the funds provided, the Committees recommend at least $2,000,000
  to monitor coral health in South Florida; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and
  seagrass monitoring in Caloosahatchee Estuary and Indian River Lagoon, especially
  with respect to assessing the impact to Lake Okeechobee discharges and harmful algal
  blooms; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and seagrass monitoring in Florida Bay
  and Biscayne Bay, especially with respect to assessing the impact of Everglades
  Restoration projects and harmful algal blooms; and $1,000,000 for the expansion
  of water quality and ecosystem health monitoring and prediction network which will
  use vetted, modern procedures for long-term monitoring of Florida waters, including
  Molecular, Algal, Ocean Floor, and Seagrasses.” Implementation of IIJA funding opportunities
  prioritizes funding for communities which are underserved and overburdened. These
  communities tend to be disproportionally at risk from climate change impacts, water
  quality issues, and lack educational opportunities. The EPA recognizes the disproportionate
  impact of pollution and climate stress on communities with environmental justice
  concerns. The agency will prioritize partners protecting and restoring water quality
  using new or innovative approaches, methods, or technologies with green infrastructure,
  nature-based solutions, and resilient infrastructure less vulnerable to flooding
  and the effects of the changing climate in low-income and underserved communities.'
