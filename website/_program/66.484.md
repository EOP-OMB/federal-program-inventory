objective: "The EPA South Florida Program provides competitive grants to address the\
  \ immediate and emerging ecological pressures and threats to south Florida waters\
  \ including fresh waters, estuaries, bays, and coral reef, central to South Florida’s\
  \ economic and ecological wellbeing. Aquatic ecosystems play a vital role supporting\
  \ healthy and resilient estuaries, coastal, inland, and near-shore infrastructure\
  \ by providing food, habitat, nutrient removal, water filtration, storm attenuation,\
  \ carbon storage, shoreline stabilization, and other financial and tangible benefits.\
  \ This assistance listing is for the South Florida Program region that includes\
  \ the 16-county area covered by South Florida Water Management District as well\
  \ as the Florida Keys, Florida Reef Tract, Caloosahatchee Estuary, Indian River\
  \ Lagoon, St. Lucie Estuary, Florida Bay, and Biscayne Bay.  The South Florida Program\
  \ competitive grants are supported by the 2024 Congressional Explanatory Statement\
  \ which provides the following:  \n\n\"The Committees recommend at least $2,000,000\
  \ to monitor coral health in South Florida; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality\
  \ and seagrass monitoring in the Caloosahatchee Estuary and Indian River Lagoon,\
  \ especially with respect to assessing the impact of Lake Okeechobee discharges\
  \ and harmful algal blooms; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and seagrass monitoring\
  \ in Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay, especially with respect to assessing the impact\
  \ of Everglades Restoration projects and harmful algal blooms; and $1,000,000 for\
  \ the expansion of the water quality and ecosystem health monitoring and prediction\
  \ network which will use vetted, modern procedures for long-term monitoring of Florida\
  \ waters, including Molecular, Algal, Ocean Floor, and Seagrasses.\"\n\nCongress\
  \ provided an additional $3.2 million to the South Florida Program through the Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\
  \ (BIL), in which Congress provided to states, tribes, local governments, and communities\
  \ to protect and restore natural habitats with a focus on climate resilience.  In\
  \ Fiscal Year 2025, funding priorities will include: 1) Aquatic Habitat Restoration\
  \ in South Florida; 2) Addressing Climate Resiliency and Water Resource Management\
  \ Issues; 3) Water Quality Monitoring and Modeling; 4) Support Local Community-Based\
  \ Projects to Protect Waterways and Aquatic Habitat; 5) Florida Reef Tract Coral\
  \ Health; 6) Nutrient Management to Reduce Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs); and 7) Stormwater/Nutrient\
  \ Pollutant Reduction Projects.  Implementation of IIJA funding opportunities also\
  \ prioritizes funding for communities which are underserved and overburdened. These\
  \ communities tend to be disproportionally at risk from climate change impacts,\
  \ water quality issues, and lack educational opportunities. The EPA recognizes the\
  \ disproportionate impact of pollution and climate stress on communities with environmental\
  \ justice concerns. The agency will prioritize partners protecting and restoring\
  \ water quality using new or innovative approaches, methods, or technologies with\
  \ green infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and resilient infrastructure less\
  \ vulnerable to flooding and the effects of the changing climate in low-income and\
  \ underserved communities."
