objective: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses a science-based, adaptive
  framework for setting and achieving broad-scale conservation objectives that strategically
  address the problems fish and wildlife will face in the future. This framework,
  called Strategic Habitat Conservation, is based on the principles of adaptive management
  and uses population and habitat data, ecological models, and focused monitoring
  and assessment efforts to develop and implement strategies that result in measurable
  fish and wildlife population outcomes. This process uses the best available scientific
  information to predict how fish and wildlife populations will respond to changes
  in the environment, thus enabling the USFWS to focus habitat conservation and other
  management activities where they will be most effective.   In addition, the USFWS
  needs focused, applied science directed at high impact questions surrounding threats
  to fish and wildlife resources for which management and/or mitigation is required
  to maintain species at healthy, sustainable, desired levels. USFWS must base its
  decisions on the best science available, in order to defend its regulatory decisions,
  biological opinions and species conservation recommendations to land managers.
