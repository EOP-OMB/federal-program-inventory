objective: The goal of the DADSS collaborative research program is to research and
  develop alcohol detection technologies that are less intrusive than currently available
  ignition interlocks. Technologies that are integrated into vehicles may hold the
  greatest promise for widespread deployment. This program is focused on the research,
  development and testing of non-invasive breath and touch-based alcohol detection
  devices and subsequent hardware that shall result in one or more commercially viable
  devices that can be installed in vehicles.
