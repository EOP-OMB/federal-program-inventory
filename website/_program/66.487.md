objective: "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) which is\
  \ generally referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), enacted November\
  \ 15, 2021, appropriated $60 million for EPA to issue grants, including grants to\
  \ non-state Hypoxia Task Force (HTF) members and key partners (21 eligible tribes,\
  \ three sub-basin committees, and a Land Grant University Consortium) to support\
  \ the implementation of the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan. This Assistance Listing considers\
  \ relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program\
  \ consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order\
  \ 14052, Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest\
  \ public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and\
  \ services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps\
  \ combat the climate crisis. Awardees are required to provide annual progress reports\
  \ which will be used to measure successful implementation and support evaluation.\
  \  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA\u2019s funding priority is to award\
  \ funds to non-state HTF partners to provide technical assistance and outreach support\
  \ to the HTF Members on nutrient reduction strategies and to advance bold, systemic\
  \ actions that accelerate nutrient load reductions in the MARB and to the Gulf of\
  \ Mexico. EPA expects entities (HTF Members) to develop workplans that prioritize\
  \ those actions most effective at to help the HTF reach the Action Plan goals and\
  \ develop capacity to reducing nutrient loads, using both proven and innovative\
  \ approaches, that are now possible with BIL funding for the Gulf Hypoxia Action\
  \ Plan.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024: EPA\u2019s funding priority is to\
  \ award funds to non-state HTF partners to provide technical assistance and outreach\
  \ support to the HTF Members on nutrient reduction strategies and to advance bold,\
  \ systemic actions that accelerate nutrient load reductions in the MARB and to the\
  \ Gulf of Mexico. EPA expects entities (HTF Members) to develop workplans that prioritize\
