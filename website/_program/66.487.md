objective: 'The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) which is
  generally referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), enacted November
  15, 2021, appropriated $60 million for EPA to issue grants, including grants to
  non-state Hypoxia Task Force (HTF) members and key partners (21 eligible tribes,
  three sub-basin committees, and a Land Grant University Consortium) to support the
  implementation of the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan. This Assistance Listing considers
  relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program
  consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order
  14052, Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public
  dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services
  are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat
  the climate crisis. Awardees are required to provide annual progress reports which
  will be used to measure successful implementation and support evaluation.  Funding
  Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA’s funding priority is to award funds to non-state
  HTF partners to provide technical assistance and outreach support to the HTF Members
  on nutrient reduction strategies and to advance bold, systemic actions that accelerate
  nutrient load reductions in the MARB and to the Gulf of Mexico. EPA expects entities
  (HTF Members) to develop workplans that prioritize those actions most effective
  at to help the HTF reach the Action Plan goals and develop capacity to reducing
  nutrient loads, using both proven and innovative approaches, that are now possible
  with BIL funding for the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year
  2024: EPA’s funding priority is to award funds to non-state HTF partners to provide
  technical assistance and outreach support to the HTF Members on nutrient reduction
