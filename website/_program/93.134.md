- description: "The Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program: In FY 2022, 374 transplant\
    \ programs in the U.S. participated in the National Living Donor Assistance Center\
    \ (NLDAC).  During that time, NLDAC received 1,987 applications for assistance,\
    \ 1,803 of which or 90.7 percent met the NLDAC eligibility guidelines.  NLDAC\
    \ provided more than $4.5 million in financial assistance and facilitated 1,111\
    \ living organ transplants.  The median household income of the transplant recipients\
    \ was $36,275 and the donors\u2019 median household income was $57,010.  \nSince\
    \ its inception in 2007, the NLDAC received more than 12,561 applications for\
    \ financial assistance and facilitated more than 6,975 living organ transplants.\
    \  The NLDAC has provided more than $26 million in financial assistance to living\
    \ donors and potential donors.\n\nIncreasing Organ Donation Awareness Grant Program:\
    \ A broad spectrum of interventions to increase donation has been implemented\
    \ at the national, State, and local levels by a variety of public and private\
    \ organizations, ranging from large-scale national media and public education\
    \ programs and statewide donor registries to community-based activities to raise\
    \ awareness among various population groups. These projects have contributed to\
    \ the knowledge base about important factors associated with the donation decision-making\
    \ process and methods for motivating people to make the commitment to become deceased\
    \ organ donors as well as educating the public about living donation and vascularized\
    \ composite allograft (VCA) donation."
