objective: The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) is an inter-Department initiative
  that is carried out by the U.S. Treasury through its CDFI fund, Health and Human
  Services’ Community Economic Development Program, and USDA’s Rural Development.  The
  purpose of the program is to improve access to affordable, healthy foods in urban
  and rural areas, particularly those areas composed predominantly of lower income
  neighborhoods and communities.  RD provides financial assistance to a National Fund
  Manager, who administers a grant program and provides technical assistance.
