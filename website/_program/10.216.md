objective: 'The Capacity Building Grants (CBG) Program is designed to build the institutional
  teaching, research, and extension capacities of the eligible institutions through
  cooperative programs with Federal and non-Federal entities.

  The CBG Program is designed to achieve three major goals:

  1.) Advance the cultural diversity of the food and agricultural sciences scientific
  and professional workforce by attracting and educating more students from underrepresented
  groups;

  2.) Strengthen linkages among the 1890 Institutions, other colleges and universities,
  USDA, other Federal agencies, and private industry; and

  3.) Enhance and strengthen the quality of teaching/education, research, and extension
  programs at the 1890 Institutions to establish them as full partners in the U.S.
  food and agricultural sciences higher education system.'
