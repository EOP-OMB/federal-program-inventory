- description: "Illinois Attorney General’s Office:  \n\nThe Illinois Office of the\
    \ Attorney General is providing specialized training to law enforcement officers\
    \ and prosecuting attorneys in Illinois, with a goal of enhancing the reporting,\
    \ identification, and prosecution of hate crimes across the state. In May 2024,\
    \ they delivered their first “homegrown” 8-hour training focusing on the history\
    \ of hate crimes and recognizing and reporting hate crimes. Plans are underway\
    \ to deliver the training throughout the state.  \n\n \n\nBroward County State\
    \ Attorney’s Office, Ft. Lauderdale, FL:  \n\nHate crimes award funding enabled\
    \ the Broward County State Attorney’s Office to create a Broward County Hate Crimes\
    \ Task Force with law enforcement and community partners to increase public awareness\
    \ of hate crimes and provide educational materials and public awareness campaigns\
    \ to reach at-risk individuals and groups. Work conducted by the task force promotes\
    \ trust between the community, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system\
    \ through training and community outreach activities. The task force efforts led\
    \ to enhanced collaboration and partnerships with community members and criminal\
    \ justice agencies in neighboring counties, resulting in two partners applying\
    \ for and receiving BJA grant funds to support their hate crime prevention and\
    \ response efforts. \n\n Maryland Attorney General’s Office:\n \nFunding from\
    \ award enabled the site to develop and roll out an online portal, nohomeforhate.md.gov,\
    \ to provide victims of hate in Maryland an additional avenue to report information\
    \ about hate crimes and bias incidents, after calling 911. With the ePortal up\
    \ and running, reports of hate/bias incidents have increased significantly in\
    \ 2024. The ePortal includes calls, text/app, and email for reporting."
