objective: "The COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities\
  \ for Testing, Treatment, and Vaccine Administration for the Uninsured Program \u2013\
  \ also known as the Uninsured Program \u2013 provides claims reimbursement to eligible\
  \ health care providers for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured, treating\
  \ uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and administering FDA-authorized\
  \ or licensed COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured individuals.\n\nThe COVID-19 Coverage\
  \ Assistance Fund (CAF) provides COVID-19 vaccine administration fee claims reimbursement\
  \ to eligible health care providers who provide COVID-19 vaccines to patients enrolled\
  \ in health coverage that either does not cover vaccine administration fees, or\
  \ does cover the administration fees but has patient cost-sharing.\n\nWith the passage\
  \ of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and related rescission of program funds,\
  \ no additional claims payments will be made under the Uninsured Program or Coverage\
  \ Assistance Fund. Per the Terms and Conditions of each Program, all reporting and\
  \ auditing requirements will continue without disruption."
