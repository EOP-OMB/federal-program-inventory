objective: 'The COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities
  for Testing, Treatment, and Vaccine Administration for the Uninsured Program – also
  known as the Uninsured Program – provides claims reimbursement to eligible health
  care providers for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured, treating uninsured
  individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and administering FDA-authorized or licensed
  COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured individuals.


  The COVID-19 Coverage Assistance Fund (CAF) provides COVID-19 vaccine administration
  fee claims reimbursement to eligible health care providers who provide COVID-19
  vaccines to patients enrolled in health coverage that either does not cover vaccine
  administration fees, or does cover the administration fees but has patient cost-sharing.


  With the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and related rescission
  of program funds, no additional claims payments will be made under the Uninsured
  Program or Coverage Assistance Fund. Per the Terms and Conditions of each Program,
  all reporting and auditing requirements will continue without disruption.'
