objective: The purpose of the assistance is to strengthen STD prevention programs
  in eligible jurisdictions. Project grants awarded under Section 318 to State and
  local health departments, academic and public health organizations emphasize the
  development and implementation of nationally uniform prevention and control programs
  which focus on the core public health functions of assessment, assurance, policy
  development, and prevention services. This includes surveillance activities, including
  the reporting, screening, and follow up of persons diagnosed with STDs, and disease
  intervention activities to find cases, and notify and refer exposed partners to
  STD into care.
