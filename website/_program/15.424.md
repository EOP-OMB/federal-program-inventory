objective: "BOEM provides financial assistance to qualified partners to identify and\
  \ evaluate OCS sediment for potential use in coastal restoration and beach nourishment\
  \ projects or programs and to foster capacity building and working relationships\
  \ with coastal States to address coastal erosion, coastal resilience, and climate\
  \ adaption.  BOEM funds activities such as conducting state-based needs assessments;\
  \ geophysical and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS; analysis\
  \ and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological data to delineate\
  \ sediment resources or benthic habitat; development of regional stratigraphic interpretations\
  \ or models; modeling to describe or understand  geologic processes that affect\
  \ sediment resources; feasibility and related technological or operations studies;\
  \ and cultural resources or shallow hazards identification.  \n\nBOEM also provides\
  \ financial assistance to qualified partners to assist in the  identification and\
  \ assessment of other potential OCS mineral resources such as critical minerals\
  \ (as defined by Executive Order 13817 – “A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and\
  \ Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals”).  BOEM funds activities such as geophysical\
  \ and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS, as well as analysis\
  \ and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological data to delineate\
  \ marine minerals."

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2018 – Awarded funds to three cooperative agreements with;
    Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, the University of Texas Institute
    of Geophysics and the University of Southern Mississippi.

    Fiscal Year 2018:  Cooperative agreements were awarded to the Virginia Department
    of Mines, Minerals and Energy to develop a feasibility study that will examine
    alternative methodologies for the recovery of economically valuable minerals from
    marine sand deposits.  The University of Texas Institute of Geophysics providing
    research on resources inventory providing development and application of Geophysical
    Processing Workflows for Sand Resource Evaluation, research will be conducted
    on the OCS off the coast of Texas.  The University of Southern Mississippi study
    combining new and existing geological and geophysical OCS data for a multi-state
    region, to develop assessments of sand and gravel resources to be made available
    for protection of communities and critical infrastructure from future coastal
    storms.

    Fiscal Year 2019 – Awarded funds to four cooperative agreements with U.S. Coastal
    Research Program (USCRP) – the University of South Florida, Alabama Geological
    Survey, Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Louisiana Coastal
    Protection and Restoration Authority.

    Fiscal Year 2019:  Cooperative agreements were awarded to USCRP – the University
    of South Florida to study whether additional bathymetric surveys should be performed
    following storms, and whether resources are truly part of the sediment budget
    of the adjacent shoreline.  The Alabama Geological Survey to recover legacy geological
    and geophysical data that will ultimately provide for development of an offshore
    sediment resources inventory.  The Florida Department of Environmental Protection
    offshore sediment resources inventory.  The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration
    Authority to expand knowledge of offshore sand resources in a way that can positively
    impact coastal restoration and protection efforts, as well as coastal resiliency
    and sediment resource inventory.

    Fiscal Year 2020:  Awarded funds to nine cooperative agreements with the Louisiana
    Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, Florida Department of Environmental
    Protection, Alabama Geological Survey, Louisiana State University Coastal Marine
    Institute, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, University of Texas Institute
    of Geophysics, Texas General Land Office and the University of Washington.

    Fiscal Year 2020:  Cooperative agreements were awarded to the Louisiana Coast
    Protection and Restoration Authority to increase the available datasets for restoration-quality
    sediment to be made available for protection of communities and critical infrastructure
    from coastal storms in Louisiana and for the continued effort to incorporate geological
    and geophysical legacy data from the State of Louisiana into the BOEM Marine Minerals
    Information System.  The Florida Department of Environmental Protection offshore
    sediment resources inventory.  The Alabama Geological Survey to recover legacy
    geological and geophysical data that will provide for development of an offshore
    sediment resources inventory.  The Louisiana State University Coastal Marine Institute
    investigating of Non-linear Sedimentation on Dredge Area Benthic Ecosystem on
    the Louisiana Shelf.  The University of Louisiana at Lafayette to examine the
    impacts of dredging on habitat and species in Ship Shoal.  The University of Texas
    Institute of Geophysics to process data in support of OCS sediment inventory.  The
    Texas General Land office to collect new geological and geophysical OCS data to
    develop assessments of sand and gravel resources to be made available for protection
    of communities and critical infrastructure from future coastal storms in Texas.  The
    University of Washington to co-investigate the In-situ Vent Analysis Divebot for
    Exobiology Research (InVADER) project.'
