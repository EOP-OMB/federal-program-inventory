objective: "BOEM provides financial assistance to qualified partners to identify and\
  \ evaluate OCS sediment for potential use in coastal restoration and beach nourishment\
  \ projects or programs and to foster capacity building and working relationships\
  \ with coastal States to address coastal erosion, coastal resilience, and climate\
  \ adaption.  BOEM funds activities such as conducting state-based needs assessments;\
  \ geophysical and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS; analysis\
  \ and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological data to delineate\
  \ sediment resources or benthic habitat; development of regional stratigraphic interpretations\
  \ or models; modeling to describe or understand  geologic processes that affect\
  \ sediment resources; feasibility and related technological or operations studies;\
  \ and cultural resources or shallow hazards identification.  \n\nBOEM also provides\
  \ financial assistance to qualified partners to assist in the  identification and\
  \ assessment of other potential OCS mineral resources such as critical minerals\
  \ (as defined by Executive Order 13817 \u2013 \u201CA Federal Strategy to Ensure\
  \ Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals\u201D).  BOEM funds activities\
  \ such as geophysical and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS,\
  \ as well as analysis and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological\
  \ data to delineate marine minerals."
