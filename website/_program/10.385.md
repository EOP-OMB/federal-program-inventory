objective: The TPEP will provide financial assistance through loan guarantees to lenders
  providing loans to entities seeking to establish, reopen, expand, or improve a sawmill
  or other wood processing facilities, and to forest workers, including loggers and
  other jobs that supply materials to these sawmills and facilities, that are using
  ecological restoration byproducts from an identified unit of USFS National Forest
  System lands. These units of USFS National Forest System lands must be classified
  as being a high or very high priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation
  removal, due to the risk of unnaturally severe wildfires, or insect or disease infestation.
  Under TPEP facilities will purchase and process the byproducts from ecosystem restoration
  projects, typically small- and mid-diameter timber.
