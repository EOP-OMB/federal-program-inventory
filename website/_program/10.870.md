objective: 'Provide rural microentrepreneurs with the skills necessary to establish
  new rural microenterprises and to provide continuing technical and financial assistance
  related to the successful operation of rural microenterprises. (1) Make direct loans
  to Microenterprise Development Organizations (MDO), which may be a non-profit entity,
  Indian Tribe or public institution of higher education for the purpose of capitalizing
  microloan revolving funds to provide fixed interest rate business loans of the lesser
  of $50,000 or 20 percent of the amount loaned to an MDO for startup and growing
  rural microenterprises. The maximum loan amount an MDO may borrower under this program
  will not exceed $500,000. (2) Make grants to MDOs to support rural microenterprise
  development. These grants are known as operational enhancement activities or services
  grants. These grants will be used to seek training and other enhancement services
  to strengthen their own organizations. These grants will not exceed  10 percent
  of available funding, whichever is less in any given year. (3) Any MDO that receives
  a loan under this program is eligible for a grant to assist microentrepreneurs who
  have received or are seeking a microloan from an MDO. These grants are known as
  technical assistance (TA) grants and may be used by an MDO to provide marketing,
  management, and other technical assistance to microentrepreneurs. TA grants will
  provide assistance specifically tailored to the needs of one or more microentrepreneurs.  '
