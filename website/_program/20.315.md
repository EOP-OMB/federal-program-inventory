- description: "In FY2017 Amtrak restructured its management and executive leadership\
    \ staff; reorganizing the business into units by different disciplines (e.g.,\
    \ Engineering, Mechanical and Financial Planning & Analysis etc.).  This organizational\
    \ shift ensured a more integrative and disciplined approach to project management\
    \ and delivery.  Amtrak also developed an Enterprise Portfolio Inventory Dashboard,\
    \ a tool that enables Amtrak, FRA and various stakeholders to track and manage\
    \ Amtrak’s investment and annualized maintenance programs and projects.  \n\n\
    Additionally, as part of the reorganization Amtrak elevated oversight and management\
    \ of the ADA Stations Program at the Vice President level which further demonstrated\
    \ the organization’s commitment to the ADA Stations Program at the highest levels\
    \ of the organization.  The ADA Stations Program was developed in order to bring\
    \ the stations Amtrak serves and for which it has ADA responsibility into compliance\
    \ with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) in the timeliest, integrated\
    \ and efficient way possible. FRA provides continuous oversight of all ADA implementation\
    \ activities throughout the lifecycle of each project."
