objective: "The Middle Mile (Broadband) Grant Program provides funding for the construction,\
  \ improvement, or acquisition of middle mile infrastructure. The purpose of the\
  \ grant program is to expand and extend middle mile infrastructure to reduce the\
  \ cost of connecting areas that are unserved or underserved to the internet backbone,\
  \ as well as to promote broadband connection resiliency through the creation of\
  \ alternative network connection paths that can be designed to prevent single points\
  \ of failure on a broadband network.  The goal of this program is to award grants\
  \ to a broad range of applications proposing creative ways to fill the gaps in our\
  \ nation\u2019s middle mile infrastructure and advance our national goals of increasing\
  \ connectivity, affordability, and equity."
