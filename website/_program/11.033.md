objective: The Middle Mile (Broadband) Grant Program provides funding for the construction,
  improvement, or acquisition of middle mile infrastructure. The purpose of the grant
  program is to expand and extend middle mile infrastructure to reduce the cost of
  connecting areas that are unserved or underserved to the internet backbone, as well
  as to promote broadband connection resiliency through the creation of alternative
  network connection paths that can be designed to prevent single points of failure
  on a broadband network.  The goal of this program is to award grants to a broad
  range of applications proposing creative ways to fill the gaps in our nationâ€™s middle
  mile infrastructure and advance our national goals of increasing connectivity, affordability,
  and equity.
