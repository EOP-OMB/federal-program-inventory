objective: The baseline tax system allows a deduction for the cost of producing income.
  It requires taxpayers to capitalize the costs associated with investments over time
  to better match the streams of income and associated costs. Research and experimentation
  (R&E) projects can be viewed as investments because, if successful, their benefits
  accrue for several years. It is often difficult, however, to identify whether a
  specific R&E project is successful and, if successful, what its expected life will
  be. Because of this ambiguity, the reference tax law baseline system would allow
  expensing of R&E expenditures. In contrast, under the normal tax method, the expensing
  of R&E expenditures is viewed as a tax expenditure. The baseline assumed for the
  normal tax method is that all R&E expenditures are successful and have an expected
  life of five years. Current law requires R&E expenditures paid or incurred in taxable
  years beginning after December 31, 2021, to be capitalized and amortized over 5
  years, while allowing R&E expenditures paid or incurred in prior taxable years to
  be expensed.
