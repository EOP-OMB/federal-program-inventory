objective: 'Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing
  people’s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the whole life course. Science
  supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this holistic
  perspective to improve individual and population health and advance health equity.
  NINR-supported research promotes health and well-being by addressing needs at multiple
  levels – individual, family, community, and societal levels – and developing treatment
  and prevention strategies that are responsive to the reality of people’s lives.
  Nurses know people, and people trust nurses. Patient and families interact with
  nurses more than any other clinicians.  Nursing science uses this special relationship
  to better understand patients, families, and communities and the many factors that
  influence their health. Nursing science supported by NINR uses this knowledge to
  develop strategies for improving health and wellness across populations, health
  care settings, and the lifespan, with an emphasis on achieving health equity. NINR-supported
  scientists have developed interventions for:  supporting parents of premature infants;
  promoting HIV prevention in underserved populations; improving transitional care
  leading to better outcomes and cost-savings; and helping inner-city children manage
  asthma. Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines
  to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness
  and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals
  at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR-supported science
  uses nursing science’s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and wide
  reach across clinical and community settings to advance our understanding of the
  social determinants of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities
  that we see, such as food insecurity and access to healthcare. NINR research efforts
  in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that
  promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness
  across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also
  focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote
  health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR also supports
  science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing
  advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. In addition,
  NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges
  and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals
  and families, health care providers, and communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding
  and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists:
  those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into
  the future. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation
  of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists
  and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who
  are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality
  health care.'
