objective: "Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing\
  \ people\u2019s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the whole life course.\
  \ Science supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this\
  \ holistic perspective to improve individual and population health and advance health\
  \ equity. NINR-supported research promotes health and well-being by addressing needs\
  \ at multiple levels \u2013 individual, family, community, and societal levels \u2013\
  \ and developing treatment and prevention strategies that are responsive to the\
  \ reality of people\u2019s lives. Nurses know people, and people trust nurses. Patient\
  \ and families interact with nurses more than any other clinicians.  Nursing science\
  \ uses this special relationship to better understand patients, families, and communities\
  \ and the many factors that influence their health. Nursing science supported by\
  \ NINR uses this knowledge to develop strategies for improving health and wellness\
  \ across populations, health care settings, and the lifespan, with an emphasis on\
  \ achieving health equity. NINR-supported scientists have developed interventions\
  \ for:  supporting parents of premature infants; promoting HIV prevention in underserved\
  \ populations; improving transitional care leading to better outcomes and cost-savings;\
  \ and helping inner-city children manage asthma. Nursing science transcends the\
  \ boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences\
  \ of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches\
  \ that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across\
  \ diverse populations and settings. NINR-supported science uses nursing science\u2019\
  s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical\
  \ and community settings to advance our understanding of the social determinants\
  \ of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities that we see, such\
  \ as food insecurity and access to healthcare. NINR research efforts in wellness\
  \ investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term\
  \ health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health\
  \ conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on\
  \ developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health\
  \ and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR also supports science\
  \ to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing advanced,\
  \ serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. In addition, NINR promotes\
  \ technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and\
  \ facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and\
  \ families, health care providers, and communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding\
  \ and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists:\
  \ those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science\
  \ into the future. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next\
  \ generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities\
  \ for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early\
  \ career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research\
  \ and high quality health care."
