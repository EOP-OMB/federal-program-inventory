objective: 'Goal(s):  Funding under this initiative is intended to help law enforcement
  and prosecutors address challenges associated with unsubmitted SAKs and unresolved
  violent crime cold cases in order to reduce the number of unsubmitted SAKs and unresolved
  cold cases in their jurisdictions. This funding is intended to give them the resources
  and tools to solve and reduce violent crimes associated with sexual assault, while
  achieving the long-term goal of improving the criminal justice response to sexual
  assault and unresolved violent crime cold cases.


  Objective(s):  To support multidisciplinary community response teams to inventory,
  track, and expeditiously test unsubmitted SAKs; collect and test lawfully owed DNA
  from offenders/arrestees; produce necessary protocols and policies to improve collaboration
  among laboratories, police, prosecutors, and victim service providers; provide resources
  to address the sexual assault investigations and prosecutions that result from evidence
  and CODIS hits produced by tested SAKs; optimize victim notification protocols and
  services as well as address the lack of criminal justice resources for other violent
  crime cold cases.


  Performance Measure 1: Total number of kits inventoried; and,
