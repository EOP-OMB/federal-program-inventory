objective: "The Rural Health Research Center program supports publicly available,\
  \ policy-relevant research to assist decision makers in understanding the challenges\
  \ faced by rural communities and providers. \nThe Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis\
  \ and Issue Specific Rural Research Studies program assists rural communities in\
  \ conducting rapid data analyses and short-term research studies to understand the\
  \ impact of policies and regulations to improve access to health care in rural communities.\
  \ \nThe Rural Health Research Dissemination Program disseminates and markets policy-oriented\
  \ information for use by diverse audiences to inform and raise awareness of issues\
  \ regarding policy implications, access, quality and status of health care delivery,\
  \ services, and management in rural communities. \nThe Rural Health Innovation and\
  \ Transformation Technical Assistance Program provides technical assistance to rural\
  \ stakeholders and the public to understand and engage in the value-based care landscape\
  \ in the context of rural health care.  \nThe Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility\
  \ Program Evaluation Cooperative Agreement improves healthcare in rural areas by\
  \ analyzing Critical Access Hospital (CAH) data, capturing best practices, and targeting\
  \ limited CAH resources.  \nThe Information Services to Rural Hospital Flexibility\
  \ Recipients Cooperative Agreement provides technical assistance, capacity building\
  \ and support to the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program and the Small Rural\
  \ Hospital Improvement Program. \nThe National Rural Health Policy, Community, and\
  \ Collaboration Program identifies and educates rural stakeholders about national\
  \ policy issues and promising practices for rural health; supports engagement of\
  \ rural communities; facilitates partnerships and collaborations to support rural\
  \ health.  \nThe State Offices of Rural Health Coordination and Development Program\
  \ (SORHCDP) builds the capacity of the 50 State Offices of Rural Health (SORH) and\
  \ rural stakeholders nationwide to better coordinate and improve rural health services.\
  \  \nThe Rural Quality Improvement Technical Assistance Cooperative Agreement provides\

  \ programs associated with specialties such as primary care, internal medicine,\
  \ psychiatry, and general preventive medicine.\nThe Targeted Technical Assistance\
  \ for Rural Hospitals Program (renamed from Vulnerable Rural Hospitals Assistance\
  \ Program) improves healthcare in rural areas by providing targeted, in-depth technical\
  \ assistance to rural hospitals within communities struggling to maintain health\
  \ care services. \nThe Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program develops\
  \ newly, accredited and sustainable rural residency programs to support expansion\
  \ of the physician workforce in rural areas. \nThe Rural Communities Opioid Response\
  \ Program-Evaluation cooperative agreement evaluates the impact of RCORP initiatives,\
  \ which currently include RCORP-Medication Assisted Treatment Access, RCORP-Implementation,\
  \ and several pilot programs. \nThe Rural Communities Opioid Response Program- Rural\
  \ Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorder builds the evidence base for what\
  \ prevention, treatment, and recovery interventions are most effective and sustainable\
  \ in rural communities and disseminates this information to strengthen the substance\
  \ use disorders (SUD) services in rural communities. \nThe Rural Healthcare Provider\
  \ Transition Project provides technical assistance to assist eligible small rural\
  \ hospitals and RHCs in strengthening their foundation in key elements of value-based\
  \ care. \nThe Rural Telementoring Training Center program trains academic medical\
