  \ conducting rapid data analyses and short-term research studies to understand the\
  \ impact of policies and regulations to improve access to health care in rural communities.\
  \ \nThe Rural Health Research Dissemination Program disseminates and markets policy-oriented\

  \ Transition Project provides technical assistance to assist eligible small rural\
