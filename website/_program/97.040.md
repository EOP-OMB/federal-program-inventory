- description: "Alert & Notification: CSEPP funded the procurement of mobile signboards\
    \ which will alert motorists to hazardous conditions in the Pueblo Community.\
    \ The FEMA-Pueblo County IPAWS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is valid through\
    \ June 2023. In addition to the required monthly tests and notifications associated\
    \ with the pandemic, Pueblo County launched an IPAWS notification in July 2021\
    \ in response to an emergency water shortage in Colorado City. They also conducted\
    \ a successful demonstration of the alerting system with the national test laboratory\
    \ during the 2022 CSEPP exercise, with messages in both Spanish and English. \n\
    Communications: Interoperability of the digital trunk radio system (purchased\
    \ through CSEPP) among a range of local response organizations\u2014including\
    \ the PCD, the City of Pueblo, and Pueblo County. Upgrading mobile and portable\
    \ radios and accessories for additional community responders, was completed in\
    \ 2022.  CSEPP Kentucky acquired a communications tower from East Kentucky Power,\
    \ and upgrades and improvements were completed for all CSEPP towers to enhance\
    \ their capability.  \nEmergency Operations Center: The emergency operations centers\
    \ (EOCs) in both CSEPP communities remained activated in  2022 in response to\
    \ wildfires and windstorms. Backup power and communication systems were successfully\
    \ implemented for these types of occurrences.  System upgrades have enabled broader\
    \ remote/virtual participation by local, state, and federal partners in EOC planning\
    \ and response activities. An upgrade to the audio-visual systems in the Pueblo\
    \ County EOC, JIC, and supporting rooms, encompassing cameras, projectors, sound\
    \ equipment, and video screens, was completed in 2022 Kentucky Emergency Management\
    \ replaced its ECIC Dispatch Console at the State Emergency Operations Center\
    \ (SEOC) to better support the 24-hour warning point. In addition, KYEM completed\
    \ a parking lot upgrade, which allowed local, state, federal, nongovernmental\
    \ organizations, and private sector partners access to the SEOC during the Eastern\
    \ Kentucky Flood Response. The server farm replacement was also completed, which\
    \ has enabled KYEM to begin the transition to a cloud-based environment. \nExercise:\
    \ The Pueblo CSEPP Community Exercise 2022 (PCD EX22) was conducted on May 4,\
    \ 2022, to demonstrate the emergency response capabilities of the Colorado CSEPP\
    \ community and to validate the correction of findings identified during past\
    \ CSEPP exercises. Exercise design and planning were accomplished by U.S. Army\
    \ and FEMA co-directors and representatives from the PCD, Pueblo County. The 2022\
    \ Blue Grass CSEPP Exercise successfully returned to a full-scale event. The CSEPP\
    \ Health and Safety Plan was followed to ensure evaluators and exercise participants\
    \ who were onsite practiced established pandemic protocols.\nProtective Actions:\
    \ CSEPP Pueblo County demonstrated AFN capability on how to perform a loop system\
    \ during an IPT to ensure voice communications were accessible to anyone with\
    \ a disability.  CSEPP Kentucky conducted a table-top exercise (TTX) to exercise\
    \ the applicability of the regional shelter plan on the CSEPP footprint when American\
    \ Red Cross resources are depleted and review operational concepts and responsibilities\
    \ outlined in the plan. Lessons learned will be incorporated into the regional\
    \ shelter plan and tested in a drill or functional exercise in the future.\nPublic\
    \ Outreach:  The \u201CPrepare Pueblo\u201D campaign continued in FY 2022 in conjunction\
    \ with ongoing pandemic response communications. This outreach campaign includes\
    \ using a website, social media, and paid advertising (theater advertisements\
    \ and roadside billboards) for public messaging. Social media campaigns were conducted\
    \ throughout the year, including during National Preparedness Month."
