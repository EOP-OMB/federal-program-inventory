objective: The objective is to enhance emergency preparedness capabilities of the
  States and local communities at the two U.S. Army chemical weapons stockpile storage
  facilities. The program’s purpose is to assist States and local communities in efforts
  to improve their capacity to plan for and respond to accidents associated with the
  storage and ultimate disposal of chemical warfare materials. Lastly, the program
  support chemical stockpile emergency preparedness program (CSEPP) recipients in
  meeting sustainability and closeout objectives for their projects within established
  guidance timelines.

results:
- description: Colorado and Kentucky communities will maintain and further enhance
    preparedness capabilities as measured by the twelve programmatic benchmarks. FEMA
    and Army will conduct a full-scale exercise at each site to evaluate community
    response capabilities and coordinated hazard-specific plans. Colorado revised
    and issued an updated CSEPP Recovery Plan based on the results of the previous
    year’s exercise. Both States enhanced alert and notification approaches through
    adoption of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. Both states initiated
    public outreach and education campaigns and conducted training across emergency
    management disciplines.  Preparedness capabilities in the Colorado and Kentucky
    communities were maintained and further enhanced as measured by the twelve programmatic
    benchmarks. A full-scale exercise was conducted at each site to evaluate community
    response capabilities. Primary and backup alert and notification and emergency
    communication systems were enhanced. Jurisdictions reviewed and updated response
    and recovery plans. Colorado conducted a series of recovery workshops, culminating
    in a tabletop exercise. Training was provided across all emergency management
    disciplines, including NIMS.

- description: Colorado and Kentucky communities maintained and further enhanced preparedness
    capabilities as measured by the twelve programmatic benchmarks, which included
    a full-scale exercise at each site, upgraded and expanded emergency communication
    and alerting systems, responder training and equipping across emergency management
    disciplines, and coordinated hazard-specific planning.  Both communities assessed
    themselves capable in all benchmarks while DOD made progress destroying chemical
    warfare agents at each site.

  year: '2021'
- description: "Alert & Notification: CSEPP funded the procurement of mobile signboards\
    \ which will alert motorists to hazardous conditions in the Pueblo Community.\
    \ The FEMA-Pueblo County IPAWS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is valid through\
    \ June 2023. In addition to the required monthly tests and notifications associated\
    \ with the pandemic, Pueblo County launched an IPAWS notification in July 2021\
    \ in response to an emergency water shortage in Colorado City. They also conducted\
    \ a successful demonstration of the alerting system with the national test laboratory\
    \ during the 2022 CSEPP exercise, with messages in both Spanish and English. \n\
    Communications: Interoperability of the digital trunk radio system (purchased\
    \ through CSEPP) among a range of local response organizations—including the PCD,\
    \ the City of Pueblo, and Pueblo County. Upgrading mobile and portable radios\
    \ and accessories for additional community responders, was completed in 2022.\
    \  CSEPP Kentucky acquired a communications tower from East Kentucky Power, and\
    \ upgrades and improvements were completed for all CSEPP towers to enhance their\
    \ capability.  \nEmergency Operations Center: The emergency operations centers\
    \ (EOCs) in both CSEPP communities remained activated in  2022 in response to\
    \ wildfires and windstorms. Backup power and communication systems were successfully\
    \ implemented for these types of occurrences.  System upgrades have enabled broader\
    \ remote/virtual participation by local, state, and federal partners in EOC planning\
    \ and response activities. An upgrade to the audio-visual systems in the Pueblo\
    \ County EOC, JIC, and supporting rooms, encompassing cameras, projectors, sound\
    \ equipment, and video screens, was completed in 2022 Kentucky Emergency Management\
    \ replaced its ECIC Dispatch Console at the State Emergency Operations Center\
    \ (SEOC) to better support the 24-hour warning point. In addition, KYEM completed\
    \ a parking lot upgrade, which allowed local, state, federal, nongovernmental\
    \ organizations, and private sector partners access to the SEOC during the Eastern\
    \ Kentucky Flood Response. The server farm replacement was also completed, which\
    \ has enabled KYEM to begin the transition to a cloud-based environment. \nExercise:\
    \ The Pueblo CSEPP Community Exercise 2022 (PCD EX22) was conducted on May 4,\
    \ 2022, to demonstrate the emergency response capabilities of the Colorado CSEPP\
    \ community and to validate the correction of findings identified during past\
    \ CSEPP exercises. Exercise design and planning were accomplished by U.S. Army\
    \ and FEMA co-directors and representatives from the PCD, Pueblo County. The 2022\
    \ Blue Grass CSEPP Exercise successfully returned to a full-scale event. The CSEPP\
    \ Health and Safety Plan was followed to ensure evaluators and exercise participants\
    \ who were onsite practiced established pandemic protocols.\nProtective Actions:\
    \ CSEPP Pueblo County demonstrated AFN capability on how to perform a loop system\
    \ during an IPT to ensure voice communications were accessible to anyone with\
    \ a disability.  CSEPP Kentucky conducted a table-top exercise (TTX) to exercise\
    \ the applicability of the regional shelter plan on the CSEPP footprint when American\
    \ Red Cross resources are depleted and review operational concepts and responsibilities\
    \ outlined in the plan. Lessons learned will be incorporated into the regional\
    \ shelter plan and tested in a drill or functional exercise in the future.\nPublic\
    \ Outreach:  The “Prepare Pueblo” campaign continued in FY 2022 in conjunction\
    \ with ongoing pandemic response communications. This outreach campaign includes\
    \ using a website, social media, and paid advertising (theater advertisements\
    \ and roadside billboards) for public messaging. Social media campaigns were conducted\
    \ throughout the year, including during National Preparedness Month."
