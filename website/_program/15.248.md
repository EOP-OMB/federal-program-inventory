objective: 'This program aims to increase the effectiveness of resource management
  by supporting research that informs effective decision-making for BLMs National
  Conservation Lands and the purposes for which they were designated, while furthering
  the administrations priorities. In addition, the program supports outcomes which
  promote citizen supported studies (i.e. citizen science) and tribal co-stewardship.
  National Conservation Lands protect more than 34 million acres, recognized for outstanding
  conservation values, and designated for special management by Acts of Congress or
  Presidential Proclamations. The BLM manages these special areas to maintain and
  enhance their conservation values with the goal to conserve, protect, and restore
  these important landscapes and their outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific
  values. These designated lands help ensure that the Nation''s extraordinary biodiversity
  and cultural heritage will be sustained for present and future generations to enjoy.
  The BLM manages units that include over 2,700 recreation sites and 22 visitor centers,
  and serve approximately 14 million visitors annually. The National Conservation
  Lands include the following unit designations: National Monuments and National Conservation
  Areas (and similar designations); Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas; Wild
  and Scenic Rivers; National Scenic and Historic Trails; and California Desert National
  Conservation Lands.'
