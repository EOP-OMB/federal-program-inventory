objective: 'This program aims to increase the effectiveness of resource management
  by supporting research that informs effective decision-making for BLMs National
  Conservation Lands and the purposes for which they were designated, while furthering
  the administrations priorities. In addition, the program supports outcomes which
  promote citizen supported studies (i.e. citizen science) and tribal co-stewardship.
  National Conservation Lands protect more than 37 million acres, recognized for outstanding
  conservation values, and designated for special management by Acts of Congress or
  Presidential Proclamations. The BLM manages these special areas to maintain and
  enhance their conservation values with the goal to conserve, protect, and restore
  these important landscapes and their outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific
  values. These designated lands help ensure that the Nation''s extraordinary biodiversity
  and cultural heritage will be sustained for present and future generations to enjoy.
  These areas include over 2,700 recreation sites and 22 visitor centers and serve
  approximately 14 million visitors annually. The National Conservation Lands include
  the following unit designations: National Monuments and National Conservation Areas
  (and similar designations); Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas; Wild and Scenic
  Rivers; National Scenic and Historic Trails; and California Desert National Conservation
  Lands.'

rules_regulations: The National Landscape Conservation System (also known as the National
  Conservation Lands) was legislatively established by the Omnibus Public Land Management
  Act of 2009 [Public Law 111-11] in order to conserve, protect, and restore nationally
  significant landscapes that have outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific
  values for the benefit of current and future generations. The National Conservation
  Lands include BLM’s National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Forest Reserves,
  legislated Outstanding Natural Areas, Cooperative Management and Protection Areas,
  Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic
  and Historic Trails. BLM policy states that “the BLM will use the best available
  science in managing NLCS units” and that “science and the scientific process will
  inform and guide management decisions concerning NLCS units” [BLM Manual §6100(1.6)(A)(9)
  and (1.6)(F)(1)]. A variety of public interest publications on these programs are
  available free of charge by contacting the appropriate State Office. Manuals providing
  basic program operational guidance for the National Landscape Conservation System
  (BLM Manual 6100), National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, and Similar
  Designations (BLM Manual 6220), Wild and Scenic Rivers (BLM Manual 6400), National
  Scenic and Historic Trails (BLM Manual 6280), Wilderness (BLM Manual 6340), and
  Wilderness Study Areas (BLM Manual 6330) may be obtained by contacting the Headquarters
  Office.
