objective: Water-Savings Conservation Grants (WSCG) provide targeted financial assistance
  to help agricultural producers continue commodity production while also helping
  irrigation districts conserve water across Western States.  The overall objectives
  are to conserve the decreasing supply of irrigation water, increase the efficiency
  of water use, upgrade existing irrigation infrastructure, strengthen water security,
  supply and distribution, and reduce adverse impacts to producers. USDA will learn
  from the diversity of strategies used and identify additional opportunities to maintain
  and expand water-saving commodity production in the future.
