objective: "The objectives of Welfare Research (WR) are to support research, evaluation,\
  \ and technical assistance related to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\
  \ (TANF) program. This includes research on the effect of State TANF programs on\
  \ employment, child well-being, unmarried births, marriage, poverty, economic mobility,\
  \ and other factors; State-initiated research on TANF ; technical assistance to\
  \ States in developing and evaluating innovative approaches for reducing welfare\
  \ dependency and increasing the well-being of families with low incomes; and development\
  \ of a “what works clearinghouse” of approaches for moving welfare recipients into\
  \ work. The objectives of the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic Mobility\
  \ are to fund projects and programs designed to improve the effectiveness of public\
  \ policies that reduce poverty, inequality, and their consequences, promote economic\
  \ mobility and equity, and further develop knowledge of the structural causes of\
  \ poverty, inequality, and economic insecurity.\nThe objectives of the Center for\
  \ Research on Hispanic Children and Families are to lead and support research on\
  \ the needs of Hispanic populations served by ACF and on promising approaches to\
  \ promote social and economic well-being among low-income Hispanic families. \n\
  The objectives of the National African American Child and Family Research Center\
  \ are to lead and support research on the assets, needs, and experiences of African\
  \ American families and children served by ACF programs, and on promising approaches\
  \ to address economic and social inequities and, ultimately, promote social and\
  \ economic well-being among low-income African American families.\nThe objectives\
  \ of the Family Self-Sufficiency and Stability Research Scholars Network Grants\
  \ are to support research on strategies for improving family self-sufficiency conducted\
  \ by social science scholars in partnership with state or local human services agencies.\n\
  The objectives of the Career Pathways Secondary Data Analysis Grants are to support\
  \ rigorous research through secondary data analysis on questions relevant to the\
  \ effectiveness of services funded by TANF programs that aim to address the employment\
  \ and self-sufficiency needs of TANF recipients and those eligible for or at risk\
  \ of TANF receipt, with career pathways programs being one such service. The objectives\
  \ of the Family Self-Sufficiency Demonstration Development Grants are to support\
  \ the planning for and execution of evaluation-related activities by organizations\
  \ looking to strengthen and evaluate coordinated, client-centered approaches to\
  \ improving economic self-sufficiency among TANF and TANF-eligible families. The\
  \ objectives of the Tribal Research Center on Early Childhood Development and Systems\
  \ are to support community-based participatory research and evaluation of ACF early\
  \ childhood and family economic well-being initiatives that serve tribal communities.\
  \ The objectives of the Baby's First Years Qualitative Substudy are to understand\
  \ how unconditional cash gifts to low-income mothers and their children affects\
  \ families' lives."
