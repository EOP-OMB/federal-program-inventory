objective: "Welfare Research (WR) funds were authorized as a set-aside of the Temporary\
  \ Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant to support research, evaluation,\
  \ and technical assistance related to the TANF program. This includes research on\
  \ the effect of State TANF programs on employment, self-sufficiency, child well-being,\
  \ unmarried births, marriage, poverty, economic mobility, and other factors; State-initiated\
  \ research on TANF; ; development of a “what works clearinghouse” of effective approaches\
  \ for moving welfare recipients into work; and technical assistance activities to\
  \ support TANF programs and services. The funding opportunities in this listing\
  \ support these objectives. \nthe objectives of the Center for Research on Hispanic\
  \ Children & Families are to lead and support research on the needs of Hispanic\
  \ populations served by ACF and on promising approaches to promote social and economic\
  \ well-being among Hispanic families with low incomes. Similarly, the objectives\
  \ of the National African American Child & Family Research Center are to lead and\
  \ support research on the assets and needs of African American families and children\
  \ served by ACF programs, and on promising approaches to promote social and economic\
  \ well-being among African American families with low incomes. The Family Self-Sufficiency\
  \ and Stability Research Scholars Network Awards are intended to support research\
  \ on strategies for improving family self-sufficiency conducted by social science\
  \ scholars in partnership with state or local human services agencies. The Career\
  \ Pathways Secondary Data Analysis Awards support rigorous research through secondary\
  \ data analysis on questions regarding the effectiveness of TANF-funded services\
  \ that aim to address the employment and self-sufficiency needs of TANF and TANF-eligible\
  \ individuals, with career pathways programs being one such service. In FY24, award\
  \ recipients of the Family Self-Sufficiency Demonstration Development Grants (awarded\
  \ in FY21 for a two-year grant period) were eligible to apply for the Family Self-Sufficiency\
  \ Demonstration Development Phase 2 Awards, which will support award recipients\
  \ in advancing the implementation and formal  testing of the approaches to improve\
  \ economic self-sufficiency among TANF and TANF-eligible families that they developed\
  \ under their initial award. The objectives of the Tribal Research Center on Early\
  \ Childhood Development and Systems Award is to support community-based participatory\
  \ research and evaluation of ACF early childhood and family economic well-being\
  \ initiatives that serve tribal communities. The objectives of the TANF Data Collaborative\
  \ Equity Analysis Awards are to support state, territory, or county TANF agencies\
  \ in conducting equity-focused analyses of their TANF and other human services data\
  \ to support program improvement and inform policymaking. The objectives of the\
  \ Center for Research on Coordinated Service Approaches to Support Whole Families\
  \ (forecasted to award in FY25) are to conduct and strengthen research on the intentional\
  \ coordination of human services to support the social and economic well-being of\
  \ families with low incomes and those from underserved communities."
