objective: The Hazardous Fuels Program supports the Wildfire Crisis Strategy to treat
  up to an additional 20 million acres of National Forest System lands and treat up
  to an additional 30 million acres of other Federal, State, Tribal and private lands.
  The Forest Service provides funding up to $20 million for non-Federal lands in support
  of this 30 million acres. The purpose of these treatments is to mitigate the adverse
  effects of uncharacteristic wildfire to protect communities, watersheds, sacred
  sites, critical habitat, and the environment.
