objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified
  in 2009 to provide a tax credit in lieu of interest to holders of qualified school
  construction bonds. The national volume limit is $22.4 billion over 2009 and 2010.
  As of March 2010, issuers of such bonds could opt to receive direct payment with
  the yield becoming fully taxable.
