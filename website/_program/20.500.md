objective: The Capital Investment Grant Program is the Federal Government’s primary
  financial resource for supporting transit capital projects that are locally planned,
  implemented, and operated. It provides funding for fixed guideway investments such
  as new and expanded heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, streetcar, bus rapid
  transit, and ferries as well as corridor-based bus rapid transit investments that
  emulate the features of rail.
