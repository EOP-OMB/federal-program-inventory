objective: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employment discrimination
  against applicants, employees, and former employees based on disability, including
  but not limited to the unlawful denial of reasonable accommodations.  The ADA also
  prohibits retaliation against an individual for filing an employment discrimination
  charge or complaint; testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an
  investigation, proceeding, or litigation under the ADA; or reasonably opposing employment
  practices that the person reasonably believes discriminate based on disability.
  The Rehabilitation Act provides federal employees with the same protections.
