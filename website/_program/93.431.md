objective: "The Office on Smoking and Health and Division of Cancer Prevention and\
  \ Control seek to build on the progress of the previously funded networks and expand\
  \ work to address tobacco-and cancer- related health disparities among populations\
  \ particularly vulnerable to tobacco industry marketing tactics and with higher\
  \ cancer incidence and death rates. To accelerate the decline in cigarette smoking,\
  \ address other tobacco use, and reduce the burden of cancer disease and death among\
  \ the entire population, it will be critical to continue to focus prevention and\
  \ control efforts on those populations that are most vulnerable and harder to reach\
  \ with general population interventions. The complex interaction of multiple factors\
  \ (e.g. socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, acculturation, inequitable\
  \ policy implementation and enforcement, stress) and persistent and targeted tobacco\
  \ industry marketing to these vulnerable populations, contribute to tobacco related\
  \ disparities. Many factors also contribute to cancer-related disparities such as\
  \ socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, diet, and access to healthcare\
  \ services. \r\n\r\nContinued efforts to address the unique need for population-specific\
  \ capacity and infrastructure to support tobacco and cancer control strategies and\
  \ promote access to tobacco cessation services, cancer prevention, and treatment\
  \ and survivor resources for populations experiencing disparities are justified.\
  \ This tailored strategy is designed to achieve the benefits of an overall population-based\
  \ policy approach to commercial tobacco and cancer control.         "
