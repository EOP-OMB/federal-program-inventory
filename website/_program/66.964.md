objective: 'The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and unique as North America''s
  largest and most biologically diverse estuary. The EPA''s Chesapeake Bay Program
  (CBP) awards annual grants to signatory jurisdictions of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed
  Agreement to support activities to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay. Current
  signatories of the Watershed Agreement include the District of Columbia, Delaware,
  Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. These grants are
  generally awarded non-competitively to signatories through allocation formulas provided
  in program guidance. Under this program, EPA awards two types of grants: 1) jurisdiction
  implementation grants, which support a signatory jurisdictionâ€™s efforts to advance
  progress toward meeting commitments under the Watershed Agreement and subsequent
  amendments; and 2) monitoring grants, which support assessment of changes to water
  quality and living resources over time. Ensuring that benefits are distributed equitably
  and increasing climate resiliency are special areas of focus for the program. More
  information regarding the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Watershed Agreement can
  be found at https://www.chesapeakebay.net/.'

results:
- description: Environmental results, measured through data collected by the states
    and shared with the federal government, show the importance of the investment
    that federal, state, and local governments have made in providing clean and safe
    water. Every year, the Chesapeake Bay Program uses available monitoring information
    from the 92 segments of the Chesapeake Bay to estimate whether each segment is
    attaining criteria for one or more of its designated uses. EPA, along with other
    federal, state, and academic partners, are using this information to demonstrate
    progress toward meeting water quality standards and the Bay TMDL. States have
    reported that, as of 2021, best management practices to reduce pollution are in
    place to achieve 49 percent of the nitrogen reductions, 64 percent of the phosphorus
    reductions, and 100 percent of the sediment reductions needed to attain applicable
    water quality standards when compared to the 2009 baseline established in the
    Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load.

rules_regulations: 'In addition to the requirements under 2 CFR 200 and 1500 (EPA
  Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
  Federal Awards), and 40 CFR Part 33 (Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises
  in United States Environmental Protection Agency Programs), the Chesapeake Bay Program
  assistance agreements must follow the U.S. EPA Chesapeake Bay Program Office Grant
  and Cooperative Agreement Guidance which is updated annually. This guidance can
