objective: 'The EPA''s Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) awards annual grants to states,
  tribes and local governments that are signatories to the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed
  Agreement to reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources in
  the Chesapeake Bay. Grants are awarded for implementation projects, regulatory/accountability,
  and monitoring, as well as other related activities. EPA''s funding priority is
  to achieve the goals and objectives established in the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed
  Agreement through the implementation of the management strategies. More detail on
  these can be found at http://www.chesapeakeprogress.com. Funded projects have helped
  support the commitments set forth in Chesapeake Executive Council agreements and
  amendments (The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983 through the 2014 Chesapeake Bay
  Watershed Agreement) and subsequent directives, adoption statements, endorsements
  and resolutions to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore and protect
  the Chesapeake Bay. These grants are generally awarded non-competitively through
  allocation formulas provided in program guidance: 1) Chesapeake Bay Regulatory and
  Accountability (CBRAP) grants: These grants are awarded to the signatory jurisdictions
  to aid in implementing and expanding their regulatory, accountability, assessment,
  compliance, and enforcement capabilities to meet the Water Quality Goal for the
  2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement and the Bay TMDL. 2) Chesapeake Bay Implementation
  Grants (CBIG): These grants are awarded non-competitively to the signatory jurisdictions
  for implementation of the management strategies and their two-year Logic & Action
  Plans developed for each of the applicable outcomes identified in the 2014 Chesapeake
  Bay Watershed Agreement. 3) Monitoring Grants: These grants are awarded to signatory
  jurisdictions for enhanced monitoring and assessment of nutrient and sediment loads,
  habitat quality, benthic community conditions, and trends of the Chesapeake Bay
  and its tidal tributaries. These grants are generally awarded non-competitively
  through allocation formulas. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Non-competitive
  grants are projected to continue to be funded for the signatory jurisdictions of
  the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement to support: (1) their regulatory and
  accountability programs, (2) the control and abatement of nonpoint source nutrient
  and sediment pollution, (3) implementation of their watershed implementation plans,
  milestone commitments and agriculture best management practices within the most
  effective basins with an emphasis on underrepresented communities, and (4) water
  quality monitoring and assessment.'

results:
- description: Environmental results, measured through data collected by the states
    and shared with the federal government, show the importance of the investment
    that federal, state, and local governments have made in providing clean and safe
    water. Every year, the Chesapeake Bay Program uses available monitoring information
    from the 92 segments of the Chesapeake Bay to estimate whether each segment is
    attaining criteria for one or more of its designated uses. EPA, along with other
    federal, state, and academic partners, are using this information to demonstrate
    progress toward meeting water quality standards and the Bay TMDL. States have
    reported that, as of 2021, best management practices to reduce pollution are in
    place to achieve 49 percent of the nitrogen reductions, 64 percent of the phosphorus
    reductions, and 100 percent of the sediment reductions needed to attain applicable
    water quality standards when compared to the 2009 baseline established in the
    Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load.
  year: '2021'
rules_regulations: 'In addition to the requirements under 2 CFR 200 and 1500 (EPA
  Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
  Federal Awards), and 40 CFR Part 33 (Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises
  in United States Environmental Protection Agency Programs), the Chesapeake Bay Program
  assistance agreements must follow the U.S. EPA Chesapeake Bay Program Office Grant
  and Cooperative Agreement Guidance which is updated annually. This guidance can
  be found at: https://www.epa.gov/restoration-chesapeake-bay/chesapeake-bay-program-grant-guidance.'
