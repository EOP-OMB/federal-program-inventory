objective: 'The EPA''s Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) awards annual grants to states,
  tribes and local governments that are signatories to the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed
  Agreement to reduce and prevent pollution and to improve the living resources in
  the Chesapeake Bay. Grants are awarded for implementation projects, regulatory/accountability,
  and monitoring, as well as other related activities. EPA''s funding priority is
  to achieve the goals and objectives established in the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed
  Agreement through the implementation of the management strategies. More detail on
  these can be found at http://www.chesapeakeprogress.com. Funded projects have helped
  support the commitments set forth in Chesapeake Executive Council agreements and
  amendments (The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983 through the 2014 Chesapeake Bay
  Watershed Agreement) and subsequent directives, adoption statements, endorsements
  and resolutions to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore and protect
  the Chesapeake Bay. These grants are generally awarded non-competitively through
  allocation formulas provided in program guidance: 1) Chesapeake Bay Regulatory and
  Accountability (CBRAP) grants: These grants are awarded to the signatory jurisdictions
  to aid in implementing and expanding their regulatory, accountability, assessment,
  compliance, and enforcement capabilities to meet the Water Quality Goal for the
  2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement and the Bay TMDL. 2) Chesapeake Bay Implementation
  Grants (CBIG): These grants are awarded non-competitively to the signatory jurisdictions
  for implementation of the management strategies and their two-year Logic & Action
  Plans developed for each of the applicable outcomes identified in the 2014 Chesapeake
  Bay Watershed Agreement. 3) Monitoring Grants: These grants are awarded to signatory
  jurisdictions for enhanced monitoring and assessment of nutrient and sediment loads,
  habitat quality, benthic community conditions, and trends of the Chesapeake Bay
  and its tidal tributaries. These grants are generally awarded non-competitively
  through allocation formulas. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Non-competitive
  grants are projected to continue to be funded for the signatory jurisdictions of
  the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement to support: (1) their regulatory and
  accountability programs, (2) the control and abatement of nonpoint source nutrient
  and sediment pollution, (3) implementation of their watershed implementation plans,
  milestone commitments and agriculture best management practices within the most
  effective basins with an emphasis on underrepresented communities, and (4) water
  quality monitoring and assessment.'
