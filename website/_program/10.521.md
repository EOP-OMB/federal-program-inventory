objective: "To marshal resources of the Land-grant Institutions (LGIs) and Cooperative\
  \ Extension Systems (CES) so that, in collaboration with other organizations, they\
  \ can develop and deliver educational programs that equip youth who are at -risk\
  \ for not meeting basic human needs with the skills they need to lead positive,\
  \ productive, and contributing lives.  The CYFAR Program is based on research on\
  \ effective programs for at-risk youth and families and on the human ecological\
  \ principle of working across the lifespan in the context of the family and community.\r\
  \n\r\nTo assure that the critical needs of children and families are met, CYFAR\
  \ supports comprehensive, intensive, community-based programs developed with active\
  \ citizen participation in all phases. CYFAR promotes building resiliency and protective\
  \ factors in youth, families, and communities.  \r\n\r\nCYFAR supports collaboration\
  \ by forming lasting partnerships to achieve greater outcomes and provides a support\
  \ base for sustaining programs for those at risk. CYFAR also promotes the use of\
  \ technology to improve programs, provides efficient access to educational resources,\
  \ and provides essential technological skills for youth and adults in at-risk environments.\r\
  \n\r\nFurther, LGIs and CES, in collaboration with other organizations, develop\
  \ and deliver educational programs that equip military-connected youth with resiliency\
  \ skills necessary to lead positive, productive, and contributing lives. The CMPC-PDTA\
  \ provides for professional development and technical assistance to CYFAR 4-H Military\
  \ partnership programs to ensure continued development and implementation of CMPC-PDTA.\
