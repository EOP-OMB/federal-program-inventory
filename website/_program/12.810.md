- description: '"Transition of Advanced Trauma, Hemorrhage and Vascular Injury Products."  This
    project provides for the development, design, refinement, evaluation, certification
    and transition of innovative dual-use technologies that will help revolutionize
    the delivery and efficacy of acute trauma and resuscitative care to patients suffering
    life threatening illnesses and injuries. The trauma and resuscitative product
    line is an especially important focus area for military medicine due to the prevalence
    and nature of injuries and illnesses that affect DoD personnel in performance
    of their mission responsibilities.'

- description: 'Field Intravenous Expeditionary System – a system to generate Sterile
    Water for Injection (SWFI) to constitute multiple formulations of intravenous
    (IV) solutions consisting of ringers lactate, lyophilized human plasma, saline
    and other sterile fluids and/or biologics and medications Expeditionary Medical
    Support system (EMEDS) sites. This is being overseen and managed by the prime
    (Military & Health Research Foundation, MHRF) and executed by the subcontractor
    (Parker-Hannifin).


    Endovascular Variable Aortic Control - a clinically viable catheter with integrated
    solid-state sensors and a blood pressure monitor that will control blood flow
    in patients with non-compressible truncal hemorrhage in a way that reduces distal
    ischemia and organ damage below the balloon when compared to current technologies.
    This project will result in a completed device ready for verification and validation
    testing in support FDA 510(k) clearance.'
