objective: 'The objectives of this program are to: 1) assist Grantees, including States,
  the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, America Samoa,
  the Northern Marianas, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands, the Virgin
  Islands, and Indian Tribes, in developing and maintaining compliance monitoring
  programs to prevent or eliminate unreasonable risks to health or the environment
  associated with chemical substances or mixtures in their communities, specifically
  Lead-based paint, Asbestos, and PCB; 2) encourage regulatory activities within the
  Grantees communities to establish their own programs for Lead-based paint and Asbestos
  (waiver programs); and 3) provide funds to support enforcement activities for Asbestos
  waiver state programs and Lead-based paint programs. EPA may provide funding for
  cooperative compliance monitoring grants to Grantees under TSCA to conduct inspections
  to ensure compliance with the PCB regulations, the Asbestos-in-Schools requirements
  (inspections at charter schools, public schools, private, non-profit schools and
  religious schools), the Model Accreditation Plan (MAP), TSCA section 6 Ban and Phase
  Out Rule, and the TSCA Asbestos Worker Protection Standards and to conduct Lead-based
  paint activities. Authorized Grantees also conduct enforcement responses for the
  Lead-based program. Grantees that have obtained an EPA waiver from the Asbestos
  regulation (Subpart E of Part 763) also have enforcement responsibilities. Funding
  Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024: Priorities for the TSCA PCB and Asbestos programs
  are: 1) ensure existing compliance monitoring programs continue to meet established
  standards; 2) promote activities that lead to waiver status for Asbestos programs;
  3) ensure states meet EPA inspector training requirements necessary to obtain and
  keep EPA credentials in those programs which require the use of EPA credentials
  (the PCB compliance monitoring programs and Asbestos programs in non-waiver states);
  4) provide inspection activity where there is an identified need including, but
  not limited to, Children''s Health and Environmental Justice areas. FY 2024 funding
  priorities for States with authorized Lead-based paint programs will focus on individuals
  and firms which conduct lead abatement and renovation and their continuance with
  the training and certification, and work practice standards requirements. States
  with authorized renovation notice rules will also monitor those requirements.'

- description: 'FY 2016 information will not be available until October 1, 2016, at
    the earliest Twenty-two Asbestos, nine PCB, and thirty-eight Lead grants were
    awarded to States in FY 2016. Agencies participating in the TSCA Compliance Monitoring
    grants program receive funds to support and enhance toxic substance compliance
    monitoring, assurance and enforcement activities. Typical program activities for
    the Asbestos grant program include compliance inspections at facilities regulated
    under the AHERA program plus preparation of inspection reports. For waiver states,
    work includes case preparation and taking enforcement action. Non-waiver states
    using EPA credentials submit their inspection reports to EPA for case review and
    appropriate enforcement action. In FY 2016, 1,093 compliance monitoring inspections
    were conducted. Typical program activities for the PCB grant program include compliance
    inspections at facilities regulated under the TSCA PCB program, and submission
    of inspection reports to EPA for review and enforcement action, if appropriate.
    In FY 2016, 346 inspections were conducted. Typical program activities for the
    Lead-based paint grant program include compliance inspections at facilities regulated
    under the TSCA Lead-based paint program plus initiation of appropriate enforcement
    action by authorized states or referral to EPA for case review and appropriate
    enforcement action when violations are detected. In FY 2016, 2,995 inspections
    were conducted. '
