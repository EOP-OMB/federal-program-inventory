objective: The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Energy Resources (ENR) programs
  support improved energy sector governance and transparency, technical engagement
  to build awareness of the challenges involved in developing unconventional resources,
  and power sector reform and development to support the expansion of access to electricity.
  Together, these programs counter poverty and lack of development resulting from
  a lack of access to energy, poor resource development, or both. The programs support
  both ENR’s global diplomatic engagement to strengthen U.S. energy security and specific
  Administration energy initiatives.
