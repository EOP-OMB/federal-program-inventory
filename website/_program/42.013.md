objective: The Library of Congress seeks to award grants to support contemporary cultural
  documentation focusing on the culture and traditions of diverse, often underrepresented
  communities in the United States today. These projects will result in archival collections
  preserved at the American Folklife Center and made accessible through the Library
  of Congress’ web site. The major goals of this grant program are to enable communities
  to document their cultural traditions, practices, and experiences from their own
  perspectives, while enhancing the Library’s holdings with materials featuring creativity
  and knowledge found at the local level. As such, successful proposals will come
  from applicants within or closely affiliated with the community they propose to
  document.
