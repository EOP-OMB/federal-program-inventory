objective: "The Library of Congress seeks to award grants to support contemporary\
  \ cultural documentation focusing on the culture and traditions of diverse, often\
  \ underrepresented communities in the United States today. These projects will result\
  \ in archival collections preserved at the American Folklife Center and made accessible\
  \ through the Library of Congress\u2019 web site. The major goals of this grant\
  \ program are to enable communities to document their cultural traditions, practices,\
  \ and experiences from their own perspectives, while enhancing the Library\u2019\
  s holdings with materials featuring creativity and knowledge found at the local\
  \ level. As such, successful proposals will come from applicants within or closely\
  \ affiliated with the community they propose to document."
