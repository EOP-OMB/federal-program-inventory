objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, expenditures to preserve and restore certified
  historic structures qualify for an investment tax credit of 20 percent for certified
  rehabilitation activities. The taxpayerâ€™s recoverable basis must be reduced by the
  amount of the credit. The credit must be claimed ratably over the five years after
  the property is placed in service, for property placed in service after December
  31, 2017.
