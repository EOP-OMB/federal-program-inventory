objective: "The purpose of this program is to fund Tribes, Tribal and urban Indian\
  \ organizations, and intertribal consortia to provide epidemiological support for\
  \ the American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) population served by IHS.  Tribal\
  \ Epidemiology Center (TEC) activities should include, but are not limited to, enhancement\
  \ of surveillance for disease conditions; research, prevention and control of disease,\
  \ injury, or disability; assessment of the effectiveness of AI/AN public health\
  \ programs; epidemiologic analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of surveillance\
  \ data; investigation of disease outbreaks; development and implementation of epidemiologic\
  \ studies; development and implementation of disease control and prevention programs;\
  \ and coordination of activities with other public health authorities in the region.\
  \  It is the intent of IHS to fund several TECs that will serve Tribes and urban\
  \ Indian communities in all 12 IHS Administrative Areas.\n\nAdditionally, this program\
  \ will fund awards under Native Public Health Resilience (NPHR) and Native Public\
  \ Health Resilience Planning (NPHRP) announcements to allow Tribes, Tribal organizations,\
  \ and Urban Indian Organizations to enhance their capacity in implementing core\
  \ Public Health functions, services, and activities, and to further develop and\
  \ improve their Public Health Management capabilities.  This program will be funded\
  \ through two funding opportunities: NPHRP will assist recipients in establishing\
  \ goals and performance measures, assessing their current management capacity, and\
  \ determining if developing a Public Health program is practicable; NPHR will fund\
  \ recipients\u2019 efforts in implementing such plans."
