objective: 'The purpose of this program is to fund Tribes, Tribal and urban Indian
  organizations, and intertribal consortia to provide epidemiological support for
  the American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) population served by IHS.  Tribal Epidemiology
  Center (TEC) activities should include, but are not limited to, enhancement of surveillance
  for disease conditions; research, prevention and control of disease, injury, or
  disability; assessment of the effectiveness of AI/AN public health programs; epidemiologic
  analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of surveillance data; investigation
  of disease outbreaks; development and implementation of epidemiologic studies; development
  and implementation of disease control and prevention programs; and coordination
  of activities with other public health authorities in the region.  It is the intent
  of IHS to fund several TECs that will serve Tribes and urban Indian communities
  in all 12 IHS Administrative Areas.


  Additionally, this program will fund awards under Native Public Health Resilience
  (NPHR) and Native Public Health Resilience Planning (NPHRP) announcements to allow
  Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to enhance their capacity
  in implementing core Public Health functions, services, and activities, and to further
  develop and improve their Public Health Management capabilities.  This program will
  be funded through two funding opportunities: NPHRP will assist recipients in establishing
  goals and performance measures, assessing their current management capacity, and
  determining if developing a Public Health program is practicable; NPHR will fund
  recipientsâ€™ efforts in implementing such plans.'
