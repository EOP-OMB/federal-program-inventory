objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue
  with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement is premised
  on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and
  the benefits of education programs serve to influence societies and affect official
  decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform, engage,
  and influence participants across strategic sectors of society – including young
  people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing
  the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans
  and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic
  choice, and individual dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity
  among Americans.  The purpose of Undergraduate Programs is to provide targeted support
  for American students to pursue intensive language study abroad and to expand the
  opportunities available for American students via study abroad programming as well
  as to provide foreign students with opportunities to gain a better understanding
  of the United States, while developing new generations of world leaders.  Undergraduate
  programs include the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (Global UGRAD); Study
  of the U.S. Institutes for Student Leaders (SUSI); Community College Initiative
  (CCI) Program ; the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program; and the Increase
  and Diversify Education Abroad for U.S. Students (IDEAS) Program.
