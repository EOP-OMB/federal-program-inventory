objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement\
  \ is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs serve to influence societies and\
  \ affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs\
  \ inform, engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society\
  \ \u2013 including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other\
  \ professionals \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand\
  \ experience with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government,\
  \ rule of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans.  The purpose of Undergraduate Programs\
  \ is to provide targeted support for American students to pursue intensive language\
  \ study abroad and to expand the opportunities available for American students via\
  \ study abroad programming as well as to provide foreign students with opportunities\
  \ to gain a better understanding of the United States, while developing new generations\
  \ of world leaders.  Undergraduate programs include the Global Undergraduate Exchange\
  \ Program (Global UGRAD); Study of the U.S. Institutes for Student Leaders (SUSI);\
  \ Community College Initiative (CCI) Program ; the Critical Language Scholarship\
  \ (CLS) Program; and the Increase and Diversify Education Abroad for U.S. Students\
  \ (IDEAS) Program (formerly the Capacity-Building Program for U.S. Undergraduate\
  \ Study Abroad)."
