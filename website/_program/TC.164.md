objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
  Security (CARES) Act provided rebates of $1,200 ($2,400 for married couples filing
  jointly) and $500 per child. The total rebate amount begins phasing out at adjusted
  gross income over $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly, $112,500
  for heads of household). This was followed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act
  which provided rebates of $600 per eligible taxpayer ($1,200 for married couples
  filing jointly) plus an additional $600 per child, with phase-out features similar
  to the CARES Act. The American Rescue Plan act provided another rebate credit of
  $1,400 ($2,800 for married couples filing jointly) and $1,400 per dependent in 2021.
  The phase out begins at the same thresholds as the CARES Act, but the full credit
  is phased out proportionately by $80,000 of AGI ($160,000 for married couples filing
  jointly, $120,000 for heads of household).
