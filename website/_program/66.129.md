objective: 'To develop and support the Southeast New England Program (SNEP) for coastal
  watershed restoration. SNEP is a geographically-based program intended to serve
  as a collaborative framework for advancing ecosystem resiliency, protecting and
  restoring water quality, habitat and ecosystem function, promoting the development
  of sustainable communities, and developing and applying innovative policy, science,
  and technology to environmental management in southeast coastal New England (eligibility
  map is available at: https://www.epa.gov/snep/background-information-southeast-new-england-program
  and will be included in competitive funding opportunities. A critical aspect of
  this framework is the integration of physical processes, water quality, and critical
  habitat at a regional, watershed, and/or landscape scale. SNEP''s Strategic Plan
  under this framework includes goals for achieving, 1. a resilient ecosystem of safe
  and healthy waters, 2. thriving watersheds and natural lands, and 3. sustainable
  communities. Additional background information on SNEP can be found at the following
  website: www.epa.gov/snep. EPA intends to fund projects, either directly or via
  a pass-through organization, that address SNEP priorities and spur investments in
  regionally significant and landscape scale restoration projects through projects,
  networks, and/or partnerships among governmental and community resource managers,
  technology, scientific, and policy organizations, nongovernmental organizations
  (NGOs), Tribes, and other groups. A major focus is to build regional capacity for
  environmental management, including developing and establishing robust institutional,
  monitoring, information, and technology frameworks that can offer more effective,
  transferable, and sustainable paths to restoring and protecting the southeast New
  England coastal watersheds. Through competitive funding announcements, EPA will
  outline specific program priorities and eligible activities in areas such as environmental,
  ecological, and/or habitat restoration planning and construction; ordinance adoption
  and implementation; technology and policy development, testing, and adoption; financing;
  monitoring, including methods, equipment, data analysis and interpretation; public
  understanding and engagement; technical training in new approaches; information
  sharing; implementation of nature-based solutions; and targeted/applied research.  SNEP
  funding is provided to support technical assistance and implementation grants through
  direct EPA awards, and subawards.  Additional SNEP funding under the  Infrastructure,
  Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will support existing SNEP priorities and will begin
  to focus on achieving program goals including climate resiliency and underserved
  communities.'
