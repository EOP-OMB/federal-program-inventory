objective: DWGs are supplemental, time-limited funding assistance provided in response
  to major economic dislocations or other events that cause significant impact on
  states and local areas that exceed the capacity of existing formula funds and other
  relevant resources.  DWGs enable states and communities to respond to and recover
  from large, unexpected dislocation events.
