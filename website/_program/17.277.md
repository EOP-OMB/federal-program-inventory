- description: "When FEMA declared COVID-19 to be a national disaster situation, it\
    \ triggered eligibility for all states and territories to apply for Disaster Recovery\
    \ as well as Employment Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grants to help address\
    \ the economic and workforce-related impacts of the pandemic.  These grants were\
    \ able to provide resources to create disaster-relief employment opportunities\
    \ for unemployed individuals to help address the health and safety impacts of\
    \ COVID-19, as well as the significant humanitarian needs caused by the pandemic.\
    \ To address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, ETA awarded 64 National Dislocated\
    \ Worker Grants (44 Disaster Recovery and 20 Employment Recovery) totaling nearly\
    \ $398 million. Grants ranged from $102,000 to approximately $40.4 million.\n\n\
    In addition to COVID, the DWG program continues to provide resources to address\
    \ natural disaster such as wildfires, hurricanes, and the Texas Ice Storm; these\
    \ grants help communities affected recover from the impacts of the disaster and\
    \ put affected individuals to work to provide income for their families as well\
    \ as helping to clean up from the effects of the disaster.  In 2020 11 new or\
    \ continuing grants were funded to address a range of natural disasters, totaling\
    \ approximately $47.6 million. The funding range for these grants was $470,000\
    \ to approximately $14.7 million. \n\nAnd DWG resources continue to be awarded\
    \ to help support individuals and communities affected by the opioid crisis through\
    \ the National Health Emergency Disaster Recovery DWGs. These grants have been\
    \ ongoing for several years, and in 2020 ETA awarded 3 new grants totaling $5.9\
    \ million."

    \ support recovery and reemployment for individuals and communities affected by\
    \ Federally-declared natural or other disasters, and mass layoff events.\n \n\
    Disaster Recovery DWGs create temporary disaster-relief employment opportunities\
    \ and enable affected individuals to access occupational training and other services.\
    \ In FY 2021 ETA awarded or continued funding to approximately 25 Disaster Recovery\
    \ DWGs that: helped individuals affected by substance misuse to obtain appropriate\
    \ services and employment; assisted communities impacted by hurricanes, wildfires,\
    \ and tornadoes clean up and recover; and continued addressing the health and\
    \ economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nETA also awarded or continued\
    \ funding for approximately 45 Employment Recovery DWGs, which provide workforce\
    \ training and other services to dislocated workers in response to mass layoff\
    \ situations. In 2021 ETA awarded 37 CAREER DWGs to help reemploy dislocated workers\
    \ most affected by the economic and employment fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic,\
    \ in particular those from historically-marginalized communities or groups, and\
    \ those who have been unemployed for an extended period of time or who have exhausted\
    \ UI or other Pandemic Unemployment Insurance programs. ETA also awarded grants\
    \ to address a facility fire that resulted in layoffs in North Carolina and military\
    \ transition from a Texas military base."
