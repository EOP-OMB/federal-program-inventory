- description: "Since its inception in 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC)\
    \ has worked to support qualified health care providers dedicated to working in\
    \ underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas.  Across the nation,\
    \ NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)\
    \ – communities with limited access to health care.  As of September 30, 2018,\
    \ there were 6,815 primary care HPSAs, 5,632 dental HPSAs, and 4,929 mental health\
    \ HPSAs.\n\nThe NHSC seeks clinicians who demonstrate a commitment to serve the\
    \ Nation’s medically underserved populations at NHSC-approved sites located in\
    \ HPSAs. NHSC-approved sites provide care to individuals regardless of ability\
    \ to pay; currently, there are over 16,400 NHSC-approved sites.  Eligible sites\
    \ include Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and FQHC Look-Alikes, American\
    \ Indian and Native Alaska health clinics, rural health clinics, critical access\
    \ hospitals and hospitals managed or owned by the Indian Health Service (IHS),\
    \ school-based clinics, mobile units, free clinics, community mental health centers,\
    \ state or local health departments, community outpatient facilities, federal\
    \ facilities such as the Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\
    \ IHS, and private practices.\n\nIn particular, the NHSC has partnered closely\
    \ with HRSA-supported FQHCs to help meet their staffing needs.  Over 60 percent\
    \ of NHSC clinicians serve in Health Centers around the nation, and 15 percent\
    \ of clinical staff at FQHCs are NHSC clinicians. The NHSC also places clinicians\
    \ in other community-based systems of care that serve underserved populations,\
    \ targeting HPSAs of greatest need. \n\nAs of September 30, 2018, there are 10,939\
    \ primary care medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health practitioners\
    \ providing service nationwide."
