objective: The Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) provides national leadership
  on disability employment policy to the Department of Labor  and other Federal agencies.
  ODEP develops and fosters the adoption and implementation of comprehensive and integrated
  disability employment policies and strategies throughout the workforce development
  system, in public and private workplaces, and in employment-related supports programs
  and services. Implementation of these effective policies and strategies increase
  employment opportunities, the recruitment of, and reduce barriers to the hiring,
  retention and promotion of people with disabilities. ODEP's response to the low
  labor force participation of people with disabilities is comprehensive and aggressive,
  and includes securing the active involvement of and cooperation among a number of
  stakeholders, including Federal, State and local government agencies, private and
  public employers, educational and training institutions, and the disability community.
