objective: To protect dairy operations and manufacturers of dairy products who through
  no fault of their own, are directed to remove their milk or dairy products from
  commercial markets because of contamination from pesticides which have been approved
  for use by the Federal government. Dairy operations can also be indemnified because
  of contamination with chemicals or toxic substances, nuclear radiation or fallout.
  Affected dairy operations provide documentation of the dumped milk losses and are
  paid through DIPP for the full value of the dumped milk. Additionally,  DIPP has
  the authority to indemnify cows that are permanently contaminated due to a chemical
  contamination. DIPP has successfully compensated dairy operations for many decades
  for dumped milk losses due to contamination issues.
