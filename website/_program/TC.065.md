objective: The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions for certain
  types of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows homeowners to exclude from gross
  income up to $250,000 ($500,000 in the case of a married couple filing a joint return)
  of the capital gains from the sale of a principal residence. To qualify, the taxpayer
  must have owned and used the property as the taxpayerâ€™s principal residence for
  a total of at least two of the five years preceding the date of sale. In addition,
  the exclusion may not be used more than once every two years.
