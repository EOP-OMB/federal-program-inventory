objective: Under the baseline tax system, the taxable income of a taxpayer who is
  an owner-occupant would include the implicit value of gross rental income on housing
  services earned on the investment in owner- occupied housing and would allow a deduction
  for expenses, such as interest, depreciation, property taxes, and other costs, associated
  with earning such rental income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from
  taxable income for the implicit gross rental income on housing services, while in
  certain circumstances allows a deduction for some costs associated with such income,
  such as for mortgage interest and property taxes.
