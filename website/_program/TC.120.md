objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Taxpayers who adopt
  eligible children from the public foster care system can receive monthly payments
  for the childrenâ€™s significant and varied needs and a reimbursement of up to $2,000
  for nonrecurring adoption expenses; special needs adoptions receive the maximum
  benefit even if that amount is not spent. These payments are excluded from gross
  income under current law.
