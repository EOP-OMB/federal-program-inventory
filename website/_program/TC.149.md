objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and
  dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment
  income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law certain contributions
  to defined benefit pension plans are excluded from an employeeâ€™s gross income until
  the money is withdrawn, even though employers can deduct their contributions. In
  addition, the tax on the investment income earned by defined benefit pension plans
  is deferred until the money is withdrawn.
