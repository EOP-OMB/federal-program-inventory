objective: 'CERCLA 104(k)(7) provides EPA with authority for a financial assistance
  program of training, research, and technical assistance to individuals and organizations
  to facilitate the inventory of brownfield properties, assessments, cleanup of brownfield
  properties, community involvement, or site preparation. Brownfield sites are real
  property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by
  the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.
  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023 and 2024: EPA intends to incrementally fund
  existing cooperative agreements with satisfactory project progress selected in previous
  104(k)(7) training, research, and technical assistance competitions. Additionally,
  using a competitive grants process, EPA may select applications and award cooperative
  agreements for technical assistance to support specific sector needs (e.g., revolving
  loan fund, Tribal governments) to help communities increase their understanding
  of brownfields issues and advance their brownfields assessment, cleanup and reuse
  goals.'
