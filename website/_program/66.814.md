objective: "Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse\
  \ of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous\
  \ substance, pollutant, or contaminant. CERCLA Section 104(k)(7) provides EPA with\
  \ authority for a financial assistance program of training, research, and technical\
  \ assistance to individuals and organizations to facilitate the inventory of brownfield\
  \ properties, assessments, cleanup of brownfield properties, community involvement,\
  \ or site preparation. \n\nPreviously funded grants may be funded under the Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act. Recipients will be required to report program accomplishments\
  \ for IIJA-funded activities in the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment, Exchange\
  \ System (ACRES) and collected data will be used to demonstrate successful implementation\
  \ of the program.\n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2025, EPA intends to incrementally\
  \ fund existing cooperative agreements with satisfactory project progress selected\
  \ in previous CERCLA Section 104(k)(7) training, research, and technical assistance\
  \ grant competitions. Additionally, using a competitive grants process, EPA may\
  \ select applications and award cooperative agreements for technical assistance\
  \ to support specific sector needs (e.g., revolving loan fund, Tribal governments)\
  \ to help communities increase their understanding of brownfields issues and advance\
  \ their brownfields assessment, cleanup and reuse goals."
