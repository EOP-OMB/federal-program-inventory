objective: In partnership with industry, the goal of the CTMA program is to leverage
  and advance commercial developments in maintenance and sustainment technology and
  processes for the primary benefit of U.S. industry and the public applying the research,
  development, evaluation, integration, and deployment to DoD issues â€“ to reduce costs,
  improve system/platform operational availabilities, increase systems reliability,
  improve logistical support efficiency and effectiveness, improve the planning and
  execution of sustainment operations, increase the resiliency of the sustainment
  industrial base, improve environmental compliance, and increase sustainment personnel
  competency and safety.

- description: Portable generators are useful when temporary or remote electrical
    power is needed, but they can also be extremely difficult to maintain, transport,
    fuel and utilize. When maintaining equipment in remote locations, standing up
    mobile hospitals, or other disaster relief activities, having a reliable source
    of power is critical. Although diesel engine generators are the standard remote
    power solution, they are also heavy, maintenance intensive, and require diesel
    fuel that in many locations, presents an extreme logistics challenge.   As an
    alternative to diesel generators, clean electrical energy storage has emerged
    as a worldwide market option.  Innovative organizations are using different renewable
    energy sources and new battery-based electrical storage devices to provide power
    necessary for remote operations and sustainment.   The intent of this initiative
    is to create a Mobile Energy Storage System (MESS) that combines clean, renewable
    power generation with energy storage in a package that can be easily and safely
    transported to an expeditionary location and be easily maintained while in use.
