objective: 'The goal of EPA''s lead-based paint program is to eliminate childhood
  lead poisoning. The program is comprised of four strategies designed to achieve
  the this goal 1) Establish standards to define where lead hazards are present in
  paint, dust and soil; 2) Give the public information about lead hazards and steps
  to protect themselves; 3) Ensure that information about known lead-based paint hazards
  is disclosed to individuals buying or renting pre-1978 housing, and that owners
  and occupants of pre-1978 housing are provided information on lead-based paint hazards
  before renovation activities take place; 4) Establish lead-safe work practice standards
  and require lead-based paint professionals and renovators who work in pre-1978 housing
  to be trained and certified. The program  assists States, Tribes, and Territories
  in developing and carrying out authorized programs that: (a) certify contractors
  engaged in lead-based paint activities and accredit lead-based paint activities
  training programs; (b) certify contractors engaged in renovation, repair and painting
  activities that disturb painted surfaces in most target housing; and/or (c) require
  distribution of lead-hazard information prior to renovation (pre-renovation education
  program).


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  Continue to provide assistance to authorized
  State, Tribal, and Territorial lead-based paint activities training and certification
  programs and pre-renovation education programs. As appropriate, the Agency will
  use grant funding to provide assistance to a State, Tribal, or Territorial program
  looking to develop or administer an authorized Renovation, Repair, and Painting
  Program. Resources in the amount of $16,326K were allocated for the Lead program
  in FY 2023.'
