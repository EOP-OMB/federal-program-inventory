objective: To enable the National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers
  (NRCASC) to be responsive to the research and management needs of Federal and State
  agencies by working with partners to provide science and technical support regarding
  the impacts of climate change in fish, wildlife, plants and ecological processes
  and the mechanisms for adaptation to, mitigation of, or prevention of those impacts.
  Center activities will focus on providing national and regional habitat and population
  modeling and forecasting tools, integrating physical climate models with ecological
  models, assessing vulnerabilities and forecasting changes, and developing standardized
  approaches.
