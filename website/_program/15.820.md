objective: To enable the National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers
  (NRCASC) to be responsive to the research and management needs of Federal and State
  agencies by working with partners to provide science and technical support regarding
  the impacts of climate change in fish, wildlife, plants and ecological processes
  and the mechanisms for adaptation to, mitigation of, or prevention of those impacts.
  Center activities will focus on providing national and regional habitat and population
  modeling and forecasting tools, integrating physical climate models with ecological
  models, assessing vulnerabilities and forecasting changes, and developing standardized
  approaches.

- description: "Past Fiscal Year (2020)\tFY2020 Overview:  92 Research Projects; 40\
    \ datasets and tools and 180 Science Articles.  In Fiscal Year 2020 (October 2019-September\
    \ 2020), the National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASC) worked\
    \ closely with partners and stakeholders to accomplish a multitude of science-based\
    \ achievements.  Some highlights include creating a framework for measuring the\
    \ ability of plants and animals to adapt to climate change, integrating climate\
    \ science with local knowledge in Hawai’i, providing climate-related training\
    \ for students and professionals, incorporating scenario planning into national\
    \ monument adaptation planning and more.  Through these activities, the CASC program\
    \ continues to find new ways to create and share climate adaptation science with\
    \ resource managers and users.  Some of the projects included: \n•\tClimate Vulnerability\
    \ of Aquatic Species to Changing Stream Temperatures and Wildfire Across the Yukon\
    \ and Kuskokwim River Basins, Alaska\n•\tThe Influence of Stream Flow Patterns\
    \ on Juvenile Salmon Growth in Southeast Alaska\n•\tScience to Inform the Management\
    \ of Mangrove Ecosystems Undergoing Sea Level Rise at Ding Darling National Wildlife\
    \ Refuge, Sanibel Island, Florida\n•\tUnderstanding Impacts of Sea-Level Rise\
    \ and Land Management on Critical Coastal Marsh Habitat"

- description: In Fiscal Year 2021, the National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science
    Centers (CASC) Program initiated approximately 70 science research projects. Obligations
    for the CASC science projects will be made under the program activity via grants
    or cooperative agreement awards through the USGS Office of Acquisitions and Grants
    (OAG). The annual report for Fiscal Year 2021 will be available following the
    end of the fiscal year and provide the current year accomplishments.
