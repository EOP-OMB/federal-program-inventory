objective: "This program’s primary goal is to assist states and units of local government\
  \ with postconviction DNA testing in cases of violent felony offenses where actual\
  \ innocence might be demonstrated.  Funded projects are expected to implement some\
  \ aspect of each of the following activities: 1. Identify potential postconviction\
  \ DNA testing cases.. 2. Review appropriate postconviction cases to identify those\
  \ in which DNA testing could prove the actual innocence of a person convicted of\
  \ a violent felony offense as defined by state law. 3. Locate biological evidence\
  \ associated with such postconviction cases. 4. Perform DNA analysis of appropriate\
  \ biological evidence. 5. Locate, record, store, and retain biological evidence\
  \ in adjudicated cases in accordance with best practices. 6. Modernize evidence\
  \ retention practices for biological evidence in accordance with best practices.\
  \ 7. Modernize and digitize the storage of existing files and records in adjudicated\
  \ cases. 8. Implement modern, digitized file and record retention systems.\n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 1: Number of new cases reviewed; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number\
  \ of exonerations."
