objective: "GOAL: To fund projects that assist States and units of local government\
  \ with postconviction DNA testing in cases of violent felony offenses where actual\
  \ innocence might be demonstrated.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Program objectives with respect\
  \ to target number of cases to be reviewed and other concrete goals must be outlined\
  \ in the proposal. Funded projects are expected to implement some aspect of each\
  \ of the following activities, except for case identification, which is not mandatory:\
  \ \n\n1. Identify potential postconviction DNA testing cases. A maximum of 15 percent\
  \ of the proposed budget may be dedicated to case identification activities. \n\n\
  2. Review appropriate postconviction cases to identify those in which DNA testing\
  \ could prove the actual innocence of a person convicted of a violent felony offense\
  \ as defined by state law. \n\n3. Locate biological evidence associated with such\
  \ postconviction cases. \n\n4. Perform DNA analysis of appropriate biological evidence.\n\
  Performance Measure 1: Number of new cases reviewed; and, \n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 2: Number of exonerations."
