objective: "To foster development and implementation of underground injection control\
  \ (UIC) programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The objective of the\
  \ grant program is to provide financial assistance to eligible states, territories,\
  \ and tribes for the implementation of their UIC Program. The fundamental goal of\
  \ the program, and the grants, is to ensure that underground sources of drinking\
  \ water are protected from endangering injection activities. \n\nFunding Priority\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2023:  The program will fund the major components of State UIC programs\
  \ which include: the development and maintenance of inventories of injection systems;\
  \ the development and maintenance of databases housing compliance information on\
  \ underground injection well activities; the implementation of UIC permitting activities;\
  \ and the implementation of enforcement programs to ensure that underground sources\
  \ of drinking water are protected from underground injection activities.  Funding\
  \ Priority - Fiscal Year 2024:  The program will continue to fund the major components\
  \ of State UIC programs which include: the development and maintenance of inventories\
