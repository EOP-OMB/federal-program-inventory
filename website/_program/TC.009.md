objective: Under the baseline tax system, the costs of exploring and developing oil
  and gas wells would be capitalized and then amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate
  of the economic life of the property. This ensures that the net income from the
  well or mine is measured appropriately each year. In contrast to this treatment,
  current law allows the immediate deduction, i.e., expensing, of intangible drilling
  costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the
  cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable
  materials used in constructing wells). Because expensing allows recovery of costs
  sooner, it is more advantageous to the taxpayer than amortization. Expensing provisions
  for exploration expenditures apply only to properties for which a deduction for
  percentage depletion is allowable. For oil and gas wells, integrated oil companies
  may expense only 70 percent of intangible drilling costs and must amortize the remaining
  30 percent over five years. Non-integrated oil companies may expense all such costs.
