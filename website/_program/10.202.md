  to increase forestry research in the production, utilization, and protection of

  in forestry research. The eligible forestry research mandated areas as defined by
  the McIntire- Stennis legislation are:

  1.)  reforestation and management of land for the production of crops of timber
  and other related products of the forest;

  2.)  management of forest and related watershed lands to improve conditions of water
  flow and to protect resources against floods and erosion;

  3.) management of forest and related rangeland for production of forage for domestic
  livestock and game and improvement of food and habitat for wildlife; management
  of forest lands for outdoor recreation; 4.) protection of forest land and resources
  against fire, insects, diseases, or other destructive agents;

  5.) utilization of wood and other forest products; and

  6.) development of sound policies for the management of forest lands and the harvesting
  and marketing of forest products; and such other studies as may be necessary to
  obtain the fullest and most effective use of forest resources.'
