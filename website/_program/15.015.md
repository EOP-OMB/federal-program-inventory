objective: The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) is intended to expand limited federal
  capacity to implement and plan forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration projects
  by facilitating partnerships with authorized states, counties, and federally recognized
  Indian tribes. The GNA authority specifically allows BLM to enhance state-federal
  relationships and addressing cross-boundary land restoration needs to include treating
  insect-and disease-infested trees; reducing hazardous fuels; any other activities
  to restore or improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health, including fish and
  wildlife habitat.  This type of work has reduced wildfire risk to habitat, communities,
  and state trust lands; creates greater forest and watershed resilience against drought,
  insects, disease, and wildfire and expands much-needed work across state and federal
  lands.  This program also supports the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
  Public Law 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration with IIJA funding limited
  to states and Indian tribes to conduct treatment on Federal lands. Section 40803
  Wildfire Risk Reduction is not limited to state and Indian Tribes or Federal Lands.
