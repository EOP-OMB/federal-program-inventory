objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and
  in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from
  cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a clergyman’s taxable
  income for the value of the clergyman’s housing allowance or the rental value of
  the clergyman’s parsonage.
