objective: "The Office of Science\u2019s (SC) mission is to deliver scientific discoveries\
  \ and major scientific tools to transform our\nunderstanding of nature and advance\
  \ the energy, economic, and national security of the United States. SC is the Nation\u2019\
  s largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and the lead\
  \ Federal agency supporting fundamental scientific research for our Nation\u2019\
  s energy future.\nSC accomplishes its mission and advances national goals by supporting:\n\
  \uF0A7 The frontiers of science\u2014exploring nature\u2019s mysteries from the\
  \ study of fundamental subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules that are the building\
  \ blocks of the materials of our universe and everything in it to the DNA, proteins,\
  \ and cells that are the building blocks of life. Each of the programs in SC supports\
  \ research probing the most fundamental disciplinary questions.\n\uF0A7 The 21st\
  \ Century tools of science\u2014providing the nation\u2019s researchers with 28\
  \ state-of-the-art national scientific user\nfacilities, the most advanced tools\
  \ of modern science, propelling the U.S. to the forefront of science, technology\n\
  development, and deployment through innovation.\n\uF0A7 Science for energy and the\
  \ environment\u2015paving the knowledge foundation to spur discoveries and innovations\
  \ for advancing the Department\u2019s mission in energy and environment. SC supports\
  \ a wide range of funding modalities from single principal investigators to large\
  \ team-based activities to engage in fundamental research on energy production,\
  \ conversion, storage, transmission, and use, and on our understanding of the earth\
  \ systems.\nSC is an established leader of the U.S. scientific discovery and innovation\
  \ enterprise. Over the decades, SC investments and accomplishments in basic research\
  \ and enabling research capabilities have provided the foundations for new technologies,\
  \ businesses, and industries, making significant contributions to our nation\u2019\
  s economy, national security, and quality of life.\nAdditional descriptions of recent\
  \ science discoveries can be found at https://science.osti.gov/Science-Features/Science-Highlights."
