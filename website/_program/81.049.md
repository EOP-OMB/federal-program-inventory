objective: 'SC is the Nation’s largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical
  sciences and the lead Federal agency supporting fundamental scientific research
  for our Nation’s energy future. SC is an established leader of the U.S. scientific
  discovery and innovation enterprise. Over the decades, SC investments and accomplishments
  in basic research and enabling research capabilities have provided the foundations
  for new technologies, businesses, and industries, making significant contributions
  to our nation’s economy, national security, and quality of life.  Additional descriptions
  of recent science discoveries can

  be found at https://science.osti.gov/Science-Features/Science-Highlights.


  SC accomplishes its mission and advances national goals by supporting:

  - Science for energy, economic and national security―building a foundation of scientific
  and technical knowledge to spur discoveries and innovations for advancing the Department’s
  mission. SC supports a wide range of funding modalities from single principal investigators
  to large team-based activities to engage in fundamental research on energy production,
  conversion, storage, transmission, and use, and on our understanding of the earth
  systems.

  - The frontiers of science—exploring nature’s mysteries from the study of fundamental
  subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules that are the building blocks of the materials
  of our universe and everything in it to the DNA, proteins, and cells that are the
  building blocks of life. Each of the programs in SC supports research probing the
  most fundamental disciplinary questions.

  - The 21st Century tools of science—providing the nation’s researchers with 28 state-of-the-art
  national scientific user

  facilities, the most advanced tools of modern science, propelling the U.S. to the
  forefront of science, technology

  development, and deployment through innovation.'
