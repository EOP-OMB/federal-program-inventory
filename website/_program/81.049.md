objective: 'The Office of Science’s (SC) mission is to deliver scientific discoveries
  and major scientific tools to transform our

  understanding of nature and advance the energy, economic, and national security
  of the United States. SC is the Nation’s largest Federal sponsor of basic research
  in the physical sciences and the lead Federal agency supporting fundamental scientific
  research for our Nation’s energy future.

  SC accomplishes its mission and advances national goals by supporting:

   The frontiers of science—exploring nature’s mysteries from the study of fundamental
  subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules that are the building blocks of the materials
  of our universe and everything in it to the DNA, proteins, and cells that are the
  building blocks of life. Each of the programs in SC supports research probing the
  most fundamental disciplinary questions.

   The 21st Century tools of science—providing the nation’s researchers with 28 state-of-the-art
  national scientific user

  facilities, the most advanced tools of modern science, propelling the U.S. to the
  forefront of science, technology

  development, and deployment through innovation.

   Science for energy and the environment―paving the knowledge foundation to spur
  discoveries and innovations for advancing the Department’s mission in energy and
  environment. SC supports a wide range of funding modalities from single principal
  investigators to large team-based activities to engage in fundamental research on
  energy production, conversion, storage, transmission, and use, and on our understanding
  of the earth systems.

  SC is an established leader of the U.S. scientific discovery and innovation enterprise.
  Over the decades, SC investments and accomplishments in basic research and enabling
  research capabilities have provided the foundations for new technologies, businesses,
  and industries, making significant contributions to our nation’s economy, national
  security, and quality of life.
