objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code provides a 30 percent investment
  credit for property used in a qualified advanced energy manufacturing project. The
  Treasury Department may award up to $12.3 billion in tax credits for qualified investments.
  Of the total $12.3 billion, $4 billion is reserved for projects located in energy
  communities.
