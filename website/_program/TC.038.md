objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code provides credits of varying amounts
  for the production within the United States and sale of specified eligible components,
  including specified solar energy components, wind energy components, inverters,
  qualifying battery components, and applicable critical minerals. The production
  of an eligible component is only eligible for a credit if sold after 2022. For all
  eligible components other than applicable critical minerals, the credit is phased
  out from 2030 to 2032, with components other than critical minerals no longer receiving
  any credit if sold after 2032.
