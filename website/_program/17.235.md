objective: 'The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is a community
  service and work-based job training program for older Americans. Authorized by the
  Older Americans Act, the program provides training for low-income, unemployed seniors.
  Participants also have access to employment assistance through American Job Centers.


  SCSEP participants gain work experience in a variety of community service activities
  at non-profit and public facilities, including schools, hospitals, day-care centers,
  and senior centers. The program provides over 40 million community service hours
  to public and non-profit agencies, allowing them to enhance and provide needed services.
  Participants work an average of 20 hours a week and are paid the highest of federal,
  state or local minimum wage. This training serves as a bridge to unsubsidized employment
  opportunities for participants.


  Participants must be at least 55, unemployed, and have a family income of no more
  than 125% of the federal poverty level. Enrollment priority is given to veterans
  and qualified spouses, then to individuals who are over 65, have a disability, have
  low literacy skills or limited English proficiency, reside in a rural area, are
  homeless or at risk of homelessness, have low employment prospects, formerly incarcerated
  within the last five years, or have failed to find employment after using services
  through the American Job Center system.'
