objective: 'The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is a community
  service and work-based job training program for older Americans. Authorized by the
  Older Americans Act, the program provides training for low-income, unemployed seniors.
  Participants also have access to employment assistance through American Job Centers.


  SCSEP participants gain work experience in a variety of community service activities
  at non-profit and public facilities, including schools, hospitals, day-care centers,
  and senior centers. The program provides over 40 million community service hours
  to public and non-profit agencies, allowing them to enhance and provide needed services.
  Participants work an average of 20 hours a week and are paid the highest of federal,
  state or local minimum wage. This training serves as a bridge to unsubsidized employment
  opportunities for participants.


  Participants must be at least 55, unemployed, and have a family income of no more
  than 125% of the federal poverty level. Enrollment priority is given to veterans
  and qualified spouses, then to individuals who are over 65, have a disability, have
  low literacy skills or limited English proficiency, reside in a rural area, are
  homeless or at risk of homelessness, have low employment prospects, formerly incarcerated
  within the last five years, or have failed to find employment after using services
  through the American Job Center system.'

- description: 'The SCSEP program provides work-based job training, support, and paid
    community service opportunities for low-income seniors with particularly intensive
    needs. Through the program, older workers gain critical soft skills and industry-specific
    skills, actively search for employment, and learn technology and internet skills,
    ultimately preparing them for unsubsidized employment opportunities after exit
    from the program. In PY 2019, SCSEP served nearly 48,000 older workers.


    In the early stages of the pandemic, ETA provided guidance and technical assistance
    to ensure that SCSEP grantees swiftly implemented measures to protect the health
    and safety of their participants, many of whom are particularly vulnerable given
    their age, socioeconomic conditions, and reliance on SCSEP wages. Measures included
    maximizing the use of available flexibilities to ensure SCSEP participants continued
    to receive critical support while they were unable to participate in community
    service assignments.'

- description: 'In Program Year 2022, Senior Community Employment Program (SCSEP)
    grantees aided over 42,400 seniors over the age of 55 gain skills and self-sufficiency
    toward unsubsidized employment. SCSEP participants conducted 3,176,807 hours of
    training, contributed 13,474,570 total hours in community service, and worked
    another 10,307,208 total hours in service to the general community.


    In Fiscal Year 2023, SCSEP implemented a new case management tool, GPMS, to better
    support the operation of the grantee performance system and its connectivity with
    internal grantee performance systems.  The additional costs associated with the
    required technology infrastructure upgrades presented a hardship for grantees,
    and the Office of Workforce Investment offered additional funding in the amount
    of $9,471,234 to SCSEP grantees to support efforts to upgrade technology infrastructure
    for GPMS compatibility.'

- description: In Fiscal Year 2024, ETA distributed grant funds totaling $402 million
    to states, territorial, and SCSEP is both a formula and competitive grant program
    in which a predetermined percentage of the funds are allocated to the States and
    territories by formula, and the remaining percentage is based on a competition
    for grants to national organizations (including set-aside grants, which are a
    subset of national grants). ETA competed the SCSEP program in 2024, which by statute
    takes place every four years. The department awarded $194 million to 19 national
    nonprofit organizations through the programâ€™s general fund, and three organizations
    received a total of $9 million in funds set aside by statute to provide employment
    services to older workers from Native American or Asian-American and Pacific Islander
    communities. The SCSEP funding will enable program participants to move into unsubsidized
    employment in public and private sectors, foster self-sufficiency, and promote
    part-time work experiences in community service assignments for unemployed low-income
    people ages 55 and older. Authorized by the Older Americans Act, the SCSEP awards
    provide funding through the end of Program Year 2024. This cohort of grantees
    may receive a total of approximately $313 million annually for an additional three
    years, subject to future appropriations.
