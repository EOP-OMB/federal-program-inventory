objective: "To provide a low-cost, long-term source of drinking water infrastructure\
  \ financing, EPA awards capitalization grants to States and Puerto Rico to capitalize\
  \ their Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (DWSRFs).  EPA also awards construction\
  \ grants to the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories (Virgin Islands, Northern\
  \ Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Guam), and Indian Tribes. Funding Priority\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2023: The funding priority established by the Safe Drinking Water\
  \ Act (SDWA)  is for capitalization grants to each state for infrastructure improvement\
  \ projects that are needed to address the most serious risk to human health, are\
  \ necessary to  achieve or maintain compliance with SDWA requirements, and assist\
  \ systems most in need on a per household basis according to State affordability\
  \ criteria.  A state may use a portion of the capitalization grant funds for programs\
  \ emphasizing contamination prevention through technical assistance, capacity development,\
  \ operator certification, and source water protection. \n\nThe program supports\
  \ the Agency's strategic goal of providing for clean and safe water.\n\nThe Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 2021, (Public Law 117-58), makes available additional\
  \ capitalization grants to each state and construction grants to the other listed\
  \ entities for the purpose of providing assistance through the Drinking Water SRF\
  \ to: (1) activities identified above, (2) activities identified above for projects\
  \ that address emerging contaminants in drinking water, and (3) activities identified\
  \ above for projects that identify and replace lead service lines (including related\
  \ planning and design projects and activities).\n\nThe capitalization grant is deposited\
  \ in the State's DWSRF, which is used to provide loans and other types of financial\
  \ assistance to public water systems as described in Section 1452 of the SDWA. A\
  \ maximum of four percent of the grant amounts, $400,000 each year, or 1/5 percent\
  \ per year of the current valuation (total net position) of the fund, whichever\
  \ is greatest, may be used by the States for the cost of administering the DWSRF.\
  \ States may discretionally take other “set-asides” for small system technical assistance,\
  \ state program management, and local assistance as described in Section 1452 of\
  \ the SDWA. States determine priorities for funding within their State in accordance\
  \ with the SDWA.\n\nFor the 51 State DWSRFs, a portion of the capitalization grant\
  \ funding must be used to provide additional subsidy in the form of grants, principal\
  \ forgiveness, or negative interest loans."
