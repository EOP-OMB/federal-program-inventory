objective: Provides 6-or 7-year grants to States and Partnerships to provide support,
  and maintain a commitment, to eligible  students from low-income backgrounds, including
  students with disabilities, to assist the students in obtaining a secondary school
  diploma (or its recognized equivalent) and to prepare for, and succeed in, postsecondary
  education. GEAR UP has two major service components.  All projects provide a comprehensive
  set of early intervention services including mentoring, tutoring, academic and career
  counseling, services to increase parental involvement, and other college preparation
  activities like exposure to college campuses and financial aid information and assistance.
  Some projects provide college scholarships to participating students.
