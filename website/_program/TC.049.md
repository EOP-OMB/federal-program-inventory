objective: The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated
  with an investment over time. However, the production of livestock and crops with
  a production period greater than two years is exempt from the uniform cost capitalization
  rules (e.g., for costs for establishing orchards or structure improvements), thereby
  accelerating cost recovery.
