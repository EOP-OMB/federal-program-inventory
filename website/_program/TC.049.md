objective: Because loan forgiveness increases a debtors net worth the baseline tax
  system requires debtors to include the amount of loan forgiveness as income or else
  reduce their recoverable basis in the property related to the loan. If the amount
  of forgiveness exceeds the basis, the excess forgiveness is taxable if the taxpayer
  is not insolvent. For bankrupt debtors, the amount of loan forgiveness reduces carryover
  losses, unused credits, and then basis, with the remainder of the forgiven debt
  excluded from taxation. Qualified farm debt that is forgiven, however, is excluded
  from income even when the taxpayer is solvent.
