objective: The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the U.S.
  Government initiative to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around
  the world. This historic commitment is the largest by any nation to combat a single
  disease internationally, and PEPFAR investments also help alleviate suffering from
  other diseases across the global health spectrum.   PEPFAR is the cornerstone and
  largest component of the U.S. President’s Global Health Initiative. With a special
  focus on improving the health of women, newborns and children, the Global Health
  Initiative’s goal is to save the greatest number of lives by increasing and building
  upon what works and, then, supporting countries as they work to improve the health
  of their own people.
