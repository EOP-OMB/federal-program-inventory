objective: "The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the U.S.\
  \ Government initiative to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS\
  \ around the world. This historic commitment is the largest by any nation to combat\
  \ a single disease internationally, and PEPFAR investments also help alleviate suffering\
  \ from other diseases across the global health spectrum.   PEPFAR is the cornerstone\
  \ and largest component of the U.S. President\u2019s Global Health Initiative. With\
  \ a special focus on improving the health of women, newborns and children, the Global\
  \ Health Initiative\u2019s goal is to save the greatest number of lives by increasing\
  \ and building upon what works and, then, supporting countries as they work to improve\
  \ the health of their own people."
