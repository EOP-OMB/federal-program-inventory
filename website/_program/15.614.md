- description: The program received 25 applications from 11 coastal States. Of these,
    20 projects from 10 states were funded with $17.4 million federal share and $20.3
    million in non-federal share. The projects cumulatively protect, restore or enhance
    more than 13,000 acres of important coastal wetland habitat, including several
    miles of shoreline. Conservation of this habitat not only benefits coastal-dependent
    federal trust species, but also enhances flood protection and water quality, and
    provides economic and recreational benefits to commercial fishermen and anglers.
