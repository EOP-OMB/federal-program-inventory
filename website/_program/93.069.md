objective: "Public health emergency preparedness and response capacity continues to\
  \ be tested at national, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. Since 9/11,\
  \ CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program has collaborated with\
  \ state, local, and territorial health departments to prepare and plan for emergencies,\
  \ resulting measurable improvement. However, ongoing risks related to chemical,\
  \ biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents as well as cyberattacks further\
  \ underscore the importance of updating and modernizing jurisdictional all-hazards\
  \ public  health preparedness and response strategies to address emerging technologies\
  \ and new 21st century threats. \n\nTo address these challenges, PHEP recipients\
  \ must increase or maintain their levels of effectiveness across six key public\
  \ health preparedness  domains and focus efforts on strengthening preparedness and\
  \ response capabilities to prevent or reduce morbidity and mortality. As additional\
  \ public threats continue to emerge, CDC must ensure that state, local, tribal,\
  \ and territorial public consequences of incidents or events whose scale, rapid\
  \ onset, or unpredictability stresses the public health system. \n\nThe program\
  \ provides fiscal resources to state, local, and territorial public health agencies\
  \ to advance their ability to demonstrate response readiness by the end of the period\
  \ of performance (performance period). This announcement also includes greater emphasis\
  \ on programmatic, fiscal,  and administrative accountability. Although the PHEP\
  \ cooperative agreement is no longer aligned with the Hospital Preparedness Program\
  \ (HPP) within a single funding opportunity, these two distinct federal preparedness\
  \ programs must continue to be organized to enhance jurisdictional coordination\
  \ and collaboration between the public health and health care systems."
