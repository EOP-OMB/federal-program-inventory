objective: The Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s (DSCA) Defense Security Cooperation
  University’s (DSCU) mission is to advance the knowledge and practice of security
  cooperation by producing research, analysis, and lessons learned that expand the
  intellectual foundations of security cooperation; and through the education, training,
  and development of the U.S. security cooperation workforce and the education, training,
  and institutional capacity building of partner nations. DSCU components sponsor
  research that aligns substantively with the Department of Defense Learning and Evaluation
  Agenda for Partnerships (LEAP) framework and the DSCU Research Agenda.

results:
- description: 'The graduate student project, “U.S. Security Cooperation Efforts in
    Iraq and Ukraine from 2012 to 2022: A Comparative Study,” judged that the success
    of U.S. security cooperation towards achieving greater partner military effectiveness
    in Iraq and Ukraine from 2012 to 2022 was most impacted by U.S. warfighting strengths
    and the ability of these strengths to address the threat faced by the partner
    force. The U.S. struggled in Iraq to teach Iraqi security forces how to tackle
    an intractable counterinsurgency that intersected with ethnosectarian and political
    instability; while in Ukraine, the U.S. was well postured to provide tactical
    and operational military support targeted towards rebuffing the advances of a
    conventional force. The report offers recommendations concerning leadership and
    combat training initiatives, U.S. understanding of the human terrain, and U.S.
    capability to appropriately measure achievements, which may create the conditions
    for greater success in generating higher levels of partner military effectiveness
    in future U.S. security cooperation efforts.'
