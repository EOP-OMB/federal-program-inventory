- description: "The graduate student project, \u201CU.S. Security Cooperation Efforts\
    \ in Iraq and Ukraine from 2012 to 2022: A Comparative Study,\u201D judged that\
    \ the success of U.S. security cooperation towards achieving greater partner military\
    \ effectiveness in Iraq and Ukraine from 2012 to 2022 was most impacted by U.S.\
    \ warfighting strengths and the ability of these strengths to address the threat\
    \ faced by the partner force. The U.S. struggled in Iraq to teach Iraqi security\
    \ forces how to tackle an intractable counterinsurgency that intersected with\
    \ ethnosectarian and political instability; while in Ukraine, the U.S. was well\
    \ postured to provide tactical and operational military support targeted towards\
    \ rebuffing the advances of a conventional force. The report offers recommendations\
    \ concerning leadership and combat training initiatives, U.S. understanding of\
    \ the human terrain, and U.S. capability to appropriately measure achievements,\
    \ which may create the conditions for greater success in generating higher levels\
    \ of partner military effectiveness in future U.S. security cooperation efforts."
