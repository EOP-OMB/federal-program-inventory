objective: "The objective is to enable each state and territory to furnish social\
  \ services best suited to the needs of the individuals residing in the state or\
  \ territory. Federal funds may be used by recipients to provide services directed\
  \ toward one of the following five goals specified in the law: \n(1) To prevent,\
  \ reduce, or eliminate dependency; \n(2) To achieve or maintain self-sufficiency;\
  \ \n(3) To prevent neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults; \n(4)\
  \ To prevent or reduce inappropriate institutional care; and \n(5) To secure admission\
  \ or referral for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate.\n\
  \nAdditionally, the Omnibus Territories Act, or Title V. of Public Law 95-134, authorizes\
  \ a consolidation of awards for the insular areas (also called 'territories') of\
  \ Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and\
  \ American Samoa. Each of these territories may submit a single application for\
  \ up to 22 health and human services programs specified in regulation at 45 CFR\
  \ Part 97.\n\nTerritories, under what is termed the Consolidated Block Grant or\
  \ CBG, are entitled to receive a single sum under the authority at Title XX or the\
  \ SSBG that can be expended on any purpose allowable under the programs in the consolidated\
  \ grant. Under SSBG, the funds may be expended for purposes as authorized for this\
  \ authority. Further, territories may determine the proportion of the consolidated\
  \ awards to be spent on various discrete services or activities.\n\nThe U.S. Department\
  \ of Health and Human Services (HHS) may waive matching and application or reporting\
  \ requirements from the different awards consolidated for territories.\n\nPrograms\
  \ eligible to be consolidated include (but are not limited to) the following: protection\
  \ services such as Title IV-B of the Social Security Act (SSA), Parts 1 and 2, Child\
  \ Welfare, Family Preservation Services; Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act\
  \ (CAPTA); Education and Training; Women and Infants nutrition assistance (WIC);\
  \ Food Stamps; Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG); Maternal and Child Health\
  \ Block Grant; State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Medicaid; Foster\
  \ Care; Adoption Assistance; Child Support, Older Americans programs, under Older\
  \ Americans Act; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the Community\
  \ Services Block Grant (CSBG), Programs for the Disabled under the Developmental\
  \ Disabilities or DD Act; Temporary Assistance to Needy Families or TANF; and Social\
  \ Services Block Grant or SSBG."
