objective: "The National Park Service \u2013 Chesapeake Bay Office connects people\
  \ to the natural and cultural heritage of the Chesapeake Bay watershed through the\
  \ Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network and supports efforts to implement\
  \ the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. \n\n\n\n\nAssistance supports implementation\
  \ of:\n\n\u2022    The Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act, which authorizes the NPS to:\
  \ identify, conserve, restore, and interpret natural, recreational, historical,\
  \ and cultural resources within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed; identify and utilize\
  \ the collective resources sites for enhancing public education of and access to\
  \ the Chesapeake Bay; link sites with trails, tour roads, scenic byways, and other\
  \ connections; develop and establish watertrails comprising water routes and connections\
  \ to sites and other land resources within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed; and create\
  \ a network of sites and watertrails. \n\n\u2022    The Chesapeake Bay Program,\
  \ a collaborative watershed restoration partnership among the states of Maryland,\
  \ Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and West Virginia, the District of\
  \ Columbia, the Chesapeake Bay Commission and the federal government. The six Governors\
  \ and the other partners signed the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement establishing\
  \ specific goals, outcomes, management strategies and work plans for conservation\
  \ and restoration. The NPS is responsible for fostering interjurisdictional collaboration\
  \ to add 300 new public boating, fishing and water access sites to the Bay and tributaries\
  \ and conserve 2 million acres of hunting, fishing, wildlife and other conservation\
  \ lands by 2025. NPS also participates in and supports other initiatives advancing\
  \ the agreement.\n\n\u2022    The partnership-based Captain John Smith Chesapeake\
  \ National Historic Trail (NHT). This 3,000 mile trail extends from Norfolk Virginia\
  \ to Cooperstown New York and along all the Bay\u2019s major tributaries. The Chesapeake\
  \ NHT was created through the National Trails System Act (Public Law 90-543, as\
  \ amended) which provides for technical and financial assistance to States or their\
  \ political subdivisions, landowners, private organizations, or individuals to operate,\
  \ develop, and maintain any portion of such a trail either within or outside a federally\
  \ administered area.\n\n\nTo advance these, the NPS collaborates with partners to\
  \ increase access to the Chesapeake and rivers, to conserve important landscapes\
  \ and resources, to promote tourism and local economies, to engage youth in meaningful\
  \ work and placed-based education, to improve recreational opportunities, and to\
  \ interpret the natural and cultural resources of the Chesapeake region."
