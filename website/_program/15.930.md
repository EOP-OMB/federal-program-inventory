objective: "The National Park Service – Chesapeake Bay Office connects people to the\
  \ natural and cultural heritage of the Chesapeake Bay watershed through the Chesapeake\
  \ Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network and supports efforts to implement the Chesapeake\
  \ Bay Watershed Agreement. \n\n\n\nAssistance supports implementation of:\n\n1)\
  \ The Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act, which authorizes the NPS to: identify, conserve,\
  \ restore, and interpret natural, recreational, historical, and cultural resources\
  \ within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed; identify and utilize the collective resources\
  \ sites for enhancing public education of and access to the Chesapeake Bay; link\
  \ sites with trails, tour roads, scenic byways, and other connections; develop and\
  \ establish watertrails comprising water routes and connections to sites and other\
  \ land resources within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed; and create a network of sites\
  \ and watertrails. \n\n2) The Chesapeake Bay Program, a collaborative watershed\
  \ restoration partnership among the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania,\
  \ Delaware, New York, and West Virginia, the District of Columbia, the Chesapeake\
  \ Bay Commission and the federal government. \n\n3) The partnership-based Captain\
  \ John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail (NHT). This 3,000 mile trail extends\
  \ from Norfolk Virginia to Cooperstown New York and along all the Bay’s major tributaries.\
  \ The Chesapeake NHT was created through the National Trails System Act (Public\
  \ Law 90-543, as amended) which provides for technical and financial assistance\
  \ to States or their political subdivisions, landowners, private organizations,\
  \ or individuals to operate, develop, and maintain any portion of such a trail either\
  \ within or outside a federally administered area.\n\n\nTo advance these, the NPS\
  \ collaborates with partners to increase access to the Chesapeake and rivers, to\
  \ conserve important landscapes and resources, to promote tourism and local economies,\
  \ to engage youth in meaningful work and placed-based education, to improve recreational\
  \ opportunities, and to interpret the natural and cultural resources of the Chesapeake\
  \ region."
