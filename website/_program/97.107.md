objective: "The purpose of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National incident Management\
  \ System (NIMS) cooperative agreement is to support Emergency Management Assistance\
  \ Compact (EMAC), which is a Congressionally ratified mutual aid compact. (Pub.\
  \ L. No. 104-321). The \u201Cpurpose of the compact is to provide for mutual assistance\
  \ between the states entering into the compact in managing any emergency disaster\
  \ that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from\
  \ natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects\
  \ of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.\u201D\
  \ See id., Section 1 Congressional Intent, Article 1, Purpose and Authorities. \
  \  EMAC signatories include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,\
  \ Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Id.\
  \ The federal government doctrinally and financially supports EMAC but does not\
  \ manage it. EMAC\u2019s unique relationships with states, regions, territories,\
  \ and Federal organizations, such as FEMA and the National Guard Bureau, enable\
  \ it to move a wide variety of resources to stabilize community lifelines immediately\
  \ after an incident. Among other things, EMAC assists states in sending personnel,\
  \ equipment, and commodities to support disaster relief efforts in other states.\
  \ \n\nThe FY 2023 NIMS cooperative agreement aids EMAC\u2019s development and maintenance\
  \ of a consistent system for the request, dispatch, use, and return of resources\
  \ necessary to support local capabilities during incident response and recovery\
  \ operations. The development of a multi-jurisdictional, interstate regional mechanism\
  \ for coordinating incident management and obtaining assistance to stabilize community\
  \ lifelines immediately during large-scale, complex, or catastrophic incidents will\
  \ help to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities essential to achieving\
  \ the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient nation."
