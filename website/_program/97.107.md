objective: "The purpose of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National incident Management\
  \ System (NIMS) cooperative agreement is to support Emergency Management Assistance\
  \ Compact (EMAC), which is a Congressionally ratified mutual aid compact. (Pub.\
  \ L. No. 104-321). The “purpose of the compact is to provide for mutual assistance\
  \ between the states entering into the compact in managing any emergency disaster\
  \ that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from\
  \ natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects\
  \ of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.” See\
  \ id., Section 1 Congressional Intent, Article 1, Purpose and Authorities.   EMAC\
  \ signatories include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam,\
  \ Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Id. The\
  \ federal government doctrinally and financially supports EMAC but does not manage\
  \ it. EMAC’s unique relationships with states, regions, territories, and Federal\
  \ organizations, such as FEMA and the National Guard Bureau, enable it to move a\
  \ wide variety of resources to stabilize community lifelines immediately after an\
  \ incident. Among other things, EMAC assists states in sending personnel, equipment,\
  \ and commodities to support disaster relief efforts in other states. \n\nThe FY\
  \ 2023 NIMS cooperative agreement aids EMAC’s development and maintenance of a consistent\
  \ system for the request, dispatch, use, and return of resources necessary to support\
  \ local capabilities during incident response and recovery operations. The development\
  \ of a multi-jurisdictional, interstate regional mechanism for coordinating incident\
  \ management and obtaining assistance to stabilize community lifelines immediately\
  \ during large-scale, complex, or catastrophic incidents will help to build, sustain,\
  \ and deliver the core capabilities essential to achieving the National Preparedness\
  \ Goal of a secure and resilient nation."
