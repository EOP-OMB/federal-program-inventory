  \ who work in law enforcement, pretrial services, the courts, probation and parole,\
  \ child welfare, reentry, emergency medical services and healthcare providers, public\
  \ health partners, and agencies who provide substance misuse treatment and recovery\
  \ support services.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage of COSSUP grantees who\
  \ are using grant funds to operate diversion programs; \n\nPerformance Measure 2:\
