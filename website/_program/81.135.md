- description: "Pending As noted in ARPA-E's FY17 Congressional Budget Justification\
    \ - In FY16 ARPA-E released funding opportunity announcements for seven focused\
    \ programs and awarded $201M to 77 projects that aim to:  improve the energy efficiency\
    \ of existing single-pane windows in commercial and residential buildings,  increase\
    \ energy efficiency of datacenters, develop new crop breeding approaches for improved\
    \ root and soil function, use renewable energy to convert air and water into cost-competitive\
    \ liquid fuels, reduce energy consumption of future vehicles, and accelerate devices\
    \ built with high performance ion-conducting solids to commercial deployment.\r\
    \n\r\nAs of February 2017, ARPA-E has invested a total of $1.5 billion across\
    \ more than 580 projects through 36 focused programs and three open funding solicitations.\
    \ This initial investment has attracted more than $1.8 billion in private sector\
    \ follow-on funding. Additionally, at least 56 ARPA-E project teams have formed\
    \ new companies and 68 projects have partnered with other government agencies\
    \ for further development."

- description: "Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided approximately $4.07 billion in R&D\
    \ funding for more than 1,690 potentially transformational energy technology projects.\
    \ \n\nARPA-E tracks key early indicators that help illustrate how the advanced\
    \ R&D funded by the Agency can potentially turn into commercial impact, including\
    \ private-sector follow-on funding, new company formation, partnership with other\
    \ government agencies, publications, inventions, and patents. In September 2024,\
    \ ARPA-E announced that many of its project teams have continued to advance their\
    \ technologies: 166 new companies have formed; 372 have partnered with another\
    \ government agency; and 250 teams have together raised more than $13.5 billion\
    \ in private-sector follow-on funding to continue to advance their technology\
    \ toward the market. Moreover, as of September 2024, ARPA-E projects have helped\
    \ advance scientific understanding and technological innovation through 7,818\
    \ peer-reviewed journal articles and 1,187 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and\
    \ Trademark Office. These indicators demonstrate that ARPA-E’s approach to selecting,\
    \ funding, and actively managing early-stage energy R&D continues to pay off,\
    \ advancing the state of the art in energy science and engineering and defining\
    \ new opportunities for commercialization of advanced energy technologies.\n\n\
