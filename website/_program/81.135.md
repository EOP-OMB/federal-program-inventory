- description: "Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided approximately $3.43 billion in R&D\
    \ funding for more than 1,503 potentially transformational energy technology projects.\
    \ \n\nARPA-E tracks key early indicators that help illustrate how the advanced\
    \ R&D funded by the Agency can potentially turn into commercial impact, including\
    \ private-sector follow-on funding, new company formation, partnership with other\
    \ government agencies, publications, inventions, and patents. In February 2023,\
    \ ARPA-E announced that many of its project teams have continued to advance their\
    \ technologies: 135 new companies have formed; 291 have partnered with another\
    \ government agency; and 204 teams have together raised more than $11.4 billion\
    \ in private-sector follow-on funding to continue to advance their technology\
    \ toward the market. Moreover, as of April 2022, ARPA-E projects have helped advance\
    \ scientific understanding and technological innovation through 6,496 peer-reviewed\
    \ journal articles and 1,001 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\
    \ These indicators demonstrate that ARPA-E\u2019s approach to selecting, funding,\
    \ and actively managing early-stage energy R&D continues to pay off, advancing\
    \ the state of the art in energy science and engineering and defining new opportunities\
    \ for commercialization of advanced energy technologies.\n\nLink:  https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=site-page/arpa-e-impact"
