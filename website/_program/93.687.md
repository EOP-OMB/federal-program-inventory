objective: "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), through its Center\
  \ for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center), seeks applications to\
  \ the Maternal Opioid Misuse (MOM) model. The MOM model is the next step in CMS\u2019\
  \ multi-pronged strategy to combat the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. The model aims\
  \ to address fragmentation in the care of pregnant and postpartum Medicaid beneficiaries\
  \ with opioid use disorder through state-driven transformation of the delivery system\
  \ surrounding this vulnerable population. By supporting the coordination of clinical\
  \ care and the integration of other services critical for health, wellbeing, and\
  \ recovery, the MOM model has the potential to improve quality of care and reduce\
  \ costs for mothers and infants"
