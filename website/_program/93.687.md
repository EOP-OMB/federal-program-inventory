objective: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), through its Center
  for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center), seeks applications to
  the Maternal Opioid Misuse (MOM) model. The MOM model is the next step in CMS’ multi-pronged
  strategy to combat the nation’s opioid crisis. The model aims to address fragmentation
  in the care of pregnant and postpartum Medicaid beneficiaries with opioid use disorder
  through state-driven transformation of the delivery system surrounding this vulnerable
  population. By supporting the coordination of clinical care and the integration
  of other services critical for health, wellbeing, and recovery, the MOM model has
  the potential to improve quality of care and reduce costs for mothers and infants
