objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income, tax credits, and write-offs faster than economic depreciation.
  In contrast, the Tax Code allows qualifying businesses in designated economically
  depressed areas to receive tax benefits such as an employment credit and special
  tax-exempt financing. A taxpayerâ€™s ability to accrue new tax benefits for empowerment
  zones expires on December 31, 2025.
