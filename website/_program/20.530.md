objective: "The goals and objectives of Public Transportation Innovation projects\
  \ vary according to the type of project, and there is a phased process where projects\
  \ build upon each other and continue based upon their success or failure. Research\
  \ projects have the ultimate goal to develop and deploy new and innovative ideas,\
  \ practices, and approaches. Eligible research projects focus on:\n(A) providing\
  \ more effective and efficient public transportation service, including services\n\
  to\u2014\n(i) seniors;\n(ii) individuals with disabilities; and\n(iii) low-income\
  \ individuals;\n(B) mobility management improvements and travel management systems;\n\
  (C) data and communication system advancements;\n(D) system capacity, including\u2014\
  \n(i) train control;\n(ii) capacity improvements; and\n(iii) performance management;\n\
  (E) capital and operating efficiencies;\n(F) planning and forecasting modeling and\
  \ simulation;\n(G) advanced vehicle design;\n(H) advancements in vehicle technology;\n\
  (I) asset maintenance and repair systems advancement;\n(J) construction and project\
  \ management;\n(K) alternative fuels;\n(L) the environment and energy efficiency;\n\
  (M) safety improvements; or\n(N) any other area that the Secretary determines is\
  \ important to advance the interests of\npublic transportation.\n\nThen, successful\
  \ research ideas can result in innovation and development projects that improve\
  \ public transportation systems nationwide to provide more efficient and effective\
  \ delivery of public transportation services, including through technology and technological\
  \ capacity improvements. Eligible innovation and development projects focus on:\n\
  \ (A) the development of public transportation research projects that received assistance\n\
  under subsection (c) that the Secretary determines were successful;\n(B) planning\
  \ and forecasting modeling and simulation;\n(C) capital and operating efficiencies;\n\
  (D) advanced vehicle design;\n(E) advancements in vehicle technology;\n(F) the environment\
  \ and energy efficiency;\n(G) system capacity, including train control and capacity\
  \ improvements; or\n(H) any other area that the Secretary determines is important\
  \ to advance the interests of\npublic transportation.\n\nDemonstration, deployment,\
  \ and evaluation projects should build on successful research, and innovation to\
  \ promote the early deployment and demonstration of innovation in public transportation\
  \ that has broad applicability. Demonstration programs require a comprehensive evaluation\
  \ within two years of the project receiving assistance. Eligible demonstration,\
  \ deployment, and evaluation projects focus on:\n(A) the deployment of research\
  \ and technology development resulting from private efforts\nor Federally funded\
  \ efforts; and\n(B) the implementation of research and technology development to\
  \ advance the interests of\npublic transportation.; or\n(C) the deployment of low\
  \ or no emission vehicles, zero emission vehicles, or associated\nadvanced technology.\n\
  \n\n\nFor the LOW OR NO EMISSION VEHICLE COMPONENT TESTING (Low-No Testing program):\
  \ FTA competitively selects at least one institution of higher education to operate\
  \ and maintain a facility to conduct testing, evaluation, and analysis of low or\
  \ no emission vehicle components intended for use in low or no emission vehicles.\
  \ The institution(s) shall have: (I) the capacity to carry out transportation-related\
  \ advanced component and vehicle evaluation; (II) laboratories capable of testing\
  \ and evaluation; and III. direct access to or a partnership with a testing facility\
  \ capable of emulating real-world circumstances in order to test low or no emission\
  \ vehicle components installed on the intended vehicle. Component testing is voluntary;\
  \ however, a low or no emission bus model muststill comply with Section 5318 Bus\
  \ Testing. \nThe TRANSIT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (TCRP) is a cooperative agreement\
  \ between FTA and the National Academies of Science to administer a public transportation\
  \ cooperative research program with an independent governing board to recommend\
  \ public transportation research, development and technology transfer activities.\
  \ The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law added a new program and enables the Low or No\
  \ Component Assessment Center to do research."
