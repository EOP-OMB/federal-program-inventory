  \n\n\nFor the LOW OR NO EMISSION VEHICLE COMPONENT TESTING (Low-No Testing program):\
  \ FTA competitively selects at least one institution of higher education to operate\
  \ and maintain a facility to conduct testing, evaluation, and analysis of low or\
  \ no emission vehicle components intended for use in low or no emission vehicles.\
  \ The institution(s) shall have: (I) the capacity to carry out transportation-related\
  \ advanced component and vehicle evaluation; (II) laboratories capable of testing\
  \ and evaluation; and III. direct access to or a partnership with a testing facility\
  \ capable of emulating real-world circumstances in order to test low or no emission\
  \ vehicle components installed on the intended vehicle. Component testing is voluntary;\
  \ however, a low or no emission bus model muststill comply with Section 5318 Bus\
  \ Testing. \nThe TRANSIT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (TCRP) is a cooperative agreement\
  \ between FTA and the National Academies of Science to administer a public transportation\
  \ cooperative research program with an independent governing board to recommend\
  \ public transportation research, development and technology transfer activities.\
  \ The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law added a new program and enables the Low or No\
  \ Component Assessment Center to do research."

    \nAccomplishments of funded projects under the Public Transportation Innovation\
    \ program in FY 2022 include:\n\n1)  FTA successfully entered into four award\
    \ agreements out of the 37 projects selected for funding under the COVID-19 Research\
    \ Demonstration program in FY 2022.  \n\n2)  FTA was presented the final design\
    \ during an interactive webinar with urban transit agencies about implementing\
    \ Bus of the Future design concepts in bus acquisitions or refurbishments. The\
    \ New Orleans Regional Transit Authority installed barriers on 108 total buses,\
    \ with two buses remaining to be completed.  This effort is part of the Redesign\
    \ of Transit Bus Operator Compartment to Improve Safety, Operational Efficiency\
    \ and Passenger Accessibility (Bus Operator Compartment) Program.\n\n3)  In FY\
    \ 2022, projects under the Integrated Mobility Innovation (IMI) Demonstration\
    \ Program activities - the Stark Area (OH) Regional Transit Authority developed\
    \ an innovative alternative payment system for mobility, business and personal\
    \ applications targeted to low-income, disadvantaged, disabled, student, elderly,\
    \ and other underserved populations. The Memphis Area Transit Authority started\
    \ the implementation of a micro-transit on demand project in Boxtown/Westwood\
    \ neighborhood of Memphis, a low-density, suburban neighborhood with a large elderly\
    \ population and infrequent transit service. All active IMI project recipients\
    \ participated in collaborative activities shared their approaches to mobility\
    \ innovation, through monthly topical meetings, quarterly exchanges, and web-based\
    \ informal exchanges. The IMI Program will have an independent evaluation for\
    \ each selected project as statutorily required.\n\n4)  Under the Accelerating\
    \ Innovative Mobility (AIM) Program - In FY 2022, the City of Wilson in rural\
    \ central North Carolina replaced its fixed-route transit service with on-demand,\
    \ rural microtransit to provide more targeted service and solve first/last mile\
    \ connections. The microtransit system includes accessible vehicles and phone\
    \ booking and restructured fares. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA)\
    \ used GPS technology to enable free transit rides for passengers who use fare\
    \ cards and board at designed stops.  The AIM Program will have an independent\
    \ evaluation for each selected project, as statutorily required once the project\
    \ is active.  All active AIM project recipients participated in AIM incubator\
    \ and Mobility Innovation Collaborative activities to collaborate and share their\
    \ approaches to mobility innovation, through monthly topical meetings, quarterly\
    \ exchanges, and web-based informal exchanges.\n\n5) Under the Infrastructure\
    \ Program - Track Asset Management Demonstration project is one of five active\
    \ projects funded under the Infrastructure Program. In FY 2022, MARTA Worked Train\
    \ continued to operate during Phase II to allow data to be gathered by Phase I\
    \ technologies and analyzed by the team for final evaluation. Beam structural\
    \ component redesigned and fabrication efforts were completed, shipped, and installed\
    \ by July 2022. MARTA and its partner completed Phase 2 Technologies test and\
