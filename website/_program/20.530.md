    \ of mobility innovations and identifying research gaps. These efforts aim to\
    \ develop a Strategic Plan that will guide the program, including the establishment\
    \ of clear goals and objectives. The Mobility NeXt program seeks to enhance transit\
    \ system design, service, and financing, ultimately making public transportation\
    \ more attractive and effective.    \n\n3) The Transit Cooperative Research Program\
    \ (TCRP) accomplished the following: Produced 18 publications, including five\
    \ research reports, seven syntheses of practice, one legal research digest, one\
    \ web-only document, one Transportation Insights publication, and three Innovations\
    \ Deserving Exploratory Analysis (IDEA) reports. This brings the total to nearly\
    \ 780 publications since the inception of the program. Project Panels: Over 150\
    \ transit industry professionals participated on 18 project panels. J-07 Synthesis:\
    \ The Synthesis Committee selected eight projects for FY 2023 funding. Held two\
    \ TOPS Commission meetings annually (June and October). At the June 2023 meeting,\
    \ three presentations were given by the Principal Investigators of recently completed\
    \ TCRP reports. At the October meeting, 14 research projects were selected for\
    \ FY 2024 funding.  \n\n4) FTA funded two Low or No Emission Vehicle Component\
    \ Assessment (Low or No CAP) Centers and utilized new provisions from the Bipartisan\
    \ Infrastructure Law (BIL) to enhance the program's effectiveness for the public\
    \ transportation industry. With these capabilities, FTA realigned the program\
