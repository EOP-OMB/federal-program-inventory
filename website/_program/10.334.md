objective: The Enhancing Agricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans Program
  provides grants to non-profits to increase the number of military veterans gaining
  knowledge and skills through comprehensive, hands-on and immersive model farm and
  ranch programs offered regionally that lead to successful careers in the food and
  agricultural sector. The program encourages the development of training opportunities
  specifically designed for military veterans. AgVets projects will offer onsite,
  hands-on training and classroom education leading to a comprehensive understanding
  of successful farm and ranch operations and management practices. Projects may also
  offer workforce readiness and employment prospects for service-disabled veterans.
  Ensuring there are pathways for military veterans interested in pursuing careers
  in agriculture — regardless of age or production choice — strengthens agricultural
  production and rural economies across the United States. NIFA requests applications
  for the AgVets to provide grants to nonprofit organizations for training programs
  and services to establish and enhance farming and ranching opportunities for military
  veterans.
