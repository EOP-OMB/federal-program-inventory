objective: "The Enhancing Agricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans Program\
  \ provides grants to non-profits to increase the number of military veterans gaining\
  \ knowledge and skills through comprehensive, hands-on and immersive model farm\
  \ and ranch programs offered regionally that lead to successful careers in the food\
  \ and agricultural sector. The program encourages the development of training opportunities\
  \ specifically designed for military veterans. AgVets projects will offer onsite,\
  \ hands-on training and classroom education leading to a comprehensive understanding\
  \ of successful farm and ranch operations and management practices. Projects may\
  \ also offer workforce readiness and employment prospects for service-disabled veterans.\
  \ Ensuring there are pathways for military veterans interested in pursuing careers\
  \ in agriculture \u2014 regardless of age or production choice \u2014 strengthens\
  \ agricultural production and rural economies across the United States. NIFA requests\
  \ applications for the AgVets to provide grants to nonprofit organizations for training\
  \ programs and services to establish and enhance farming and ranching opportunities\
