objective: "To defray travel and per diem expenses of State, local, tribal, and Territorial\
  \ emergency management personnel who attend training courses conducted by the Emergency\
  \ Management Institute (EMI), at the Emmitsburg, Maryland facility; the Center for\
  \ Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston, Alabama; and selected off-site locations.\
  \ Its purpose is to improve emergency management practices among State, local, tribal,\
  \ and Territorial government managers, in response to emergencies and disasters.\
  \ Programs embody the Comprehensive Emergency Management System by unifying the\
  \ elements of management common to all emergencies: planning, preparedness, mitigation,\
  \ response, and recovery. EMI training is conducted in an effort to strengthen the\
  \ security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for\
  \ the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including\
  \ acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters.\
  \ This program supports the national training program as mentioned in the Robert\
  \ T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and the national preparedness\
  \ system.  This program also supports FEMA\u2019s strategic plan goal 3 to promote\
  \ and sustain a ready FEMA and prepared nation. Performance measures are based on\
  \ total cost per student day of training for EMI resident, off-site and Independent\
  \ Study courses and total number of offerings and student completions (per quarter)\
  \ for resident, non-resident, virtual, and webinar deliveries."
