  resulting from crime, and to encourage victim cooperation and participation in the
  criminal justice system.


  The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC),  Department of Justice, administers the Crime
  Victim Compensation formula grant program. OVC annually awards a grant to each state,
  the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto
  Rico to support state crime victim compensation programs. These programs help pay
  for some of the expenses resulting from crimes involving violence or abuse.'
