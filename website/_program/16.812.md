objective: "There are currently over 2.2 million individuals serving time in federal\
  \ and state prisons, and millions of people cycle through local jails every year.\
  \ Of those in state and federal prison, approximately 95 percent will be released\
  \ and return to communities across the nation. A majority of these individuals have\
  \ needs that, if unaddressed in prison, during the reentry process, and after release,\
  \ will negatively impact their ability to live productive, pro-social, crime-free\
  \ lives in the community. These needs include housing and employment challenges,\
  \ relationship and family issues, and substance abuse and mental health problems.\
  \ \n\nThe Second Chance Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-199) helps to address these significant\
  \ challenges by providing comprehensive responses to the significant number of incarcerated\
  \ adults who are returning to communities from prison, jail, and juvenile residential\
  \ facilities. \n\nGoal: The SCA supports state, local, and tribal governments and\
  \ non-profit organizations in their work to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes\
  \ for people returning from state and federal prisons, local jails, and juvenile\
  \ facilities. \n\nObjective:  Promote public safety by ensuring that the transition\
  \ individuals make from prison and jail to the community is successful.  These programming\
  \ services sustain successful community reentry with coordination between government\
  \ stakeholders including state prisons and local jails, community-based organizations,\
  \ faith-based institutions, behavioral health providers, and unrealized stakeholders\
  \ focusing on transitional support.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of people\
  \ served in SCA programs; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Percent of participants\
  \ successfully completing the SCA program."
