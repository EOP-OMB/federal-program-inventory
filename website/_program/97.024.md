objective: "This program does not accept unsolicited proposals; the only eligible\
  \ applicant to FEMA for EFSP funds is the Emergency Food and Shelter Program National\
  \ Board.  EFSP funding is sub-awarded by the National Board to supplement the on-going\
  \ efforts of local service organizations to provide emergency food and shelter to\
  \ those in need. The goal and objective of the program is to assist those experiencing,\
  \ or at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness.  Program funds support\
  \ the National Preparedness Goal (NPG) by complementing actions undertaken to achieve\
  \ an \u201Call-of-Nation preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available\
  \ resources.\u201D When a disaster strikes, it is often the poor or those with economic\
  \ vulnerabilities who suffer the most. By providing emergency economic assistance\
  \ that keeps people off the streets, from being evicted from their homes, or with\
  \ groceries to prevent hunger, the EFSP prepares a population that could otherwise\
  \ be even more adversely impacted by a disaster situation and mitigates potential\
  \ burdens imposed on recovery efforts to assist such people. For additional details\
  \ on the NPG, please refer to http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf. FYs 2019,\
  \ 2021, 2022, and 2023 supplemental program funding was provided to EFSP for humanitarian\
  \ relief, such as shelter and other services to migrant families and individuals\
  \ encountered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."
