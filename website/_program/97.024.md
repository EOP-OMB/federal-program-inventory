objective: This program does not accept unsolicited proposals; the only eligible applicant
  to FEMA for EFSP funds is the Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board.  EFSP
  funding is sub-awarded by the National Board to supplement the on-going efforts
  of local service organizations to provide emergency food and shelter to those in
  need. The goal and objective of the program is to assist those experiencing, or
  at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness.  Program funds support the
  National Preparedness Goal (NPG) by complementing actions undertaken to achieve
  an “all-of-Nation preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources.”
  When a disaster strikes, it is often the poor or those with economic vulnerabilities
  who suffer the most. By providing emergency economic assistance that keeps people
  off the streets, from being evicted from their homes, or with groceries to prevent
  hunger, the EFSP prepares a population that could otherwise be even more adversely
  impacted by a disaster situation and mitigates potential burdens imposed on recovery
  efforts to assist such people. For additional details on the NPG, please refer to
  http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf. FYs 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023 supplemental
  program funding was provided to EFSP for humanitarian relief, such as shelter and
  other services to migrant families and individuals encountered by the U.S. Department
  of Homeland Security (DHS).
