objective: 'EPA provides Indian Environmental General Assistance Program (GAP) financial
  and technical assistance to tribal governments and intertribal consortia to assist
  tribes in planning, developing, and establishing the capacity to implement federal
  environmental programs administered by the EPA and to assist in implementation of
  tribal solid and hazardous waste programs in accordance with applicable provisions
  of law, including the Solid Waste Disposal Act (commonly known as the Resource Conservation
  and Recovery Act, or RCRA). See the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program
  Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. §4368b). EPA administers this program in accordance with
  the statute, applicable federal regulations, including 40 CFR part 35, subpart B
  (Environmental Program Grants for Tribes), and national guidance, including the
  2022 Indian Environmental General Assistance Program (GAP) Guidance on Financial
  Assistance Agreements (referred to as GAP Guidance). EPA’s 2022 GAP Guidance provides
  a consistent national framework for building tribal environmental program capacity
  under GAP and is designed to improve the management of GAP resources. Funding Priorities
  - Fiscal Year 2023:  The 2022 Guidance incorporates, with amendments, and supersedes
  the 2017 GAP Guiding Principles.'
