objective: 'Significant federal investments to accelerate the adoption of electronic
  health records (EHRs) and exchange of clinical data are now in place. It is critical
  to continue to track the adoption and use of EHRs and related insights to: (1) ascertain
  the status of adoption and evaluate existing and proposed policy decisions; (2)
  evaluate the impact of ONC programs and related incentives for meaningful use; and
  (3) make resources available to ONC and external researchers to assess the effects
  of health IT adoption and exchange on key aspects of care, such as quality and efficiency.
  The data generated under this funding opportunity will enable ONC and researchers
  to carry out these important activities for inpatient settings.'
