objective: 'Significant federal investments to accelerate the adoption of electronic
  health records (EHRs) and exchange of clinical data are now in place. It is critical
  to continue to track the adoption and use of EHRs and related insights to: (1) ascertain
  the status of adoption and evaluate existing and proposed policy decisions; (2)
  evaluate the impact of ONC programs and related incentives for meaningful use; and
  (3) make resources available to ONC and external researchers to assess the effects
  of health IT adoption and exchange on key aspects of care, such as quality and efficiency.
  The data generated under this funding opportunity will enable ONC and researchers
  to carry out these important activities for inpatient settings.


  The program was also set up to measure the use of health information technology
  (IT) among office-based physicians. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is
  to measure the use and impacts of health IT, and level of interoperability among
  a nationally representative sample of U.S. office-based physicians. The cooperative
  agreement is intended to produce national-level data on interoperability and use
  of health IT by office-based physicians. These data shall provide national-level
  insights on the implementation and effects of federal health IT policies as well
  as identify disparities or unintended consequences resulting from their implementation.'
