objective: The purpose of the Healthy Start (HS) program is to improve health outcomes
  before, during, and after pregnancy, and reduce racial/ethnic differences in rates
  of infant death and adverse perinatal outcomes. The HS program provides grants to
  high-risk communities with infant mortality rates at least 1.5 times the U.S. national
  average and high rates of other adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., low birthweight,
  preterm birth, maternal morbidity and mortality).  HS works to reduce the disparity
  in health status between the general population and individuals who are members
  of racial or ethnic minority groups.
