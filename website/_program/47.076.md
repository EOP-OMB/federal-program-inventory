objective: 'To provide leadership and ensure the vitality of the Nation''s science,
  technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education enterprise. The STEM Education
  component of the National Science Foundation sponsors programs that support the
  development of models and strategies for providing all students with access to high-quality
  STEM education, and research about those models and strategies. In addition, support
  is provided for scholarships and fellowships for STEM students. The portfolio of
  programs in STEM education comprises efforts spanning pre-K to 12, undergraduate,
  graduate and post-doctoral levels, as well as informal education and life-long learning.
  Long-term goals include: supporting infrastructure and institutional capacity building
  that will enable development of high-quality educational experiences for all students;
  ensuring that our educational pathways yield an adequately educated and diverse
  corps of individuals for the highly technical workplace, the professional STEM community,
  and society; developing a cadre of professionally educated and well-trained teachers
  and faculty; and providing the research necessary to inform and improve educational
  practice. Many programs are conducted in partnership with NSFâ€™s other directorates.
  Programs include research and development support for improving STEM learning and
  learning environments, including learning technologies, both in formal and informal
  learning settings; STEM workforce development, including the development of teachers;
  and broadening participation. Programs are subject to continuous improvements based
  on program reviews, evaluation, dissemination of best practices, and educational
  research.'
