objective: "To provide leadership and ensure the vitality of the Nation's science,\
  \ technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education enterprise. The STEM\
  \ Education component of the National Science Foundation sponsors programs that\
  \ support the development of models and strategies for providing all students with\
  \ access to high-quality STEM education, and research about those models and strategies.\
  \ In addition, support is provided for scholarships and fellowships for STEM students.\
  \ The portfolio of programs in STEM education comprises efforts spanning pre-K to\
  \ 12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels, as well as informal education\
  \ and life-long learning. Long-term goals include: supporting infrastructure and\
  \ institutional capacity building that will enable development of high-quality educational\
  \ experiences for all students; ensuring that our educational pathways yield an\
  \ adequately educated and diverse corps of individuals for the highly technical\
  \ workplace, the professional STEM community, and society; developing a cadre of\
  \ professionally educated and well-trained teachers and faculty; and providing the\
  \ research necessary to inform and improve educational practice. Many programs are\
  \ conducted in partnership with NSF\u2019s other directorates. Programs include\
  \ research and development support for improving STEM learning and learning environments,\
  \ including learning technologies, both in formal and informal learning settings;\
  \ STEM workforce development, including the development of teachers; and broadening\
  \ participation. Programs are subject to continuous improvements based on program\
  \ reviews, evaluation, dissemination of best practices, and educational research."
