objective: The overall goal of the 2501 Program is to encourage and assist socially
  disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, veteran farmers and ranchers, and beginning
  farmers and ranchers with owning and operating farms and ranches and in participating
  equitably in the full range of agricultural, forestry, and related programs offered
  by USDA.  In partnership with the OPPE, eligible entities may compete for funding
  on projects that provide education and training in agriculture, agribusiness, forestry,
  agriculturally related services, and USDA programs, and to conduct outreach initiatives
  designed to accomplish those goals.  This partnership includes working closely with
  OPPE, attend OPPE-led events in your proposed service territory, and collaborate
  with USDA Service Centers located in your state (Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources
  Conservation Service, and Rural Development).
