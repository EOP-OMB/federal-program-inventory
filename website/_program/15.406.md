objective: 'The National Park Centennial Initiative is an effort to prepare national
  parks for another century of conservation, preservation, and public enjoyment. Project
  efforts will improve parks and serve all Americans.


  Since 2015, the National Park Service has leveraged more than $88 million in funding
  from Congress through the Centennial Challenge program to attract more than $119
  million from partner organizations to support hundreds of projects across the country.


  These projects reduce the maintenance backlog, improve visitor services, support
  outreach to new audiences, and strengthen partnerships to reinvigorate national
  parks and forge connections to new communities.'
