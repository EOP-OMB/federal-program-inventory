objective: This program advances the Department of the Interior’s role as stewards
  of the public lands by cultivating community-based conservation and partnerships.
  This program provides support and guidance for carrying out the expenditure of appropriated
  funds generated from the sale of public lands in Lincoln and White Pine Counties
  in eastern Nevada.  A primary goal of this program is to carry out the inventory,
  evaluation, protection, and management of unique archeological resources and also
  encompasses recreation improvements and wildlife habitat. The program will focus
  funded partnerships on key activities in support of the Department of the Interior's
  priorities to address the climate crisis, restore balance on public lands and waters,
  advance environmental justice, strengthening the government -to-government relationship
  with sovereign Tribal Nations, and invest in a clean energy future, where there
  is clear alignment of bureau priorities

- description: In FY 2021 a recipient of LCAI funding closed out a Nevada State Parks
    project. The Nevada Site Stewardship Program (NSSP), managed by the Nevada State
    Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), worked closely with Nevada State Parks to
    enhance archaeological resource management and public engagement. This was accomplished
    by developing and improving the knowledge, skills, and tools needed for State
    Parks to manage, protect, and preserve their archaeological resources while also
    providing opportunities for public education and participation in cultural resource
    preservation at State Parks in Lincoln County. NSSP approached this goal by focusing
    efforts in three areas. First, NSSP educated State Parks and the community about
    State Parks’ archaeological resources through the creation of a comprehensive
    overview document which places the resources within the history and prehistory
    of the County and a brochure for the public highlighting archaeological resources
    at the parks and their preservation. Second, NSSP trained State Park staff on
    how to identify cultural resources on State Park lands, engage with the public
    to encourage an appreciation for the local archaeology, and provide a process
    for the public to report when they discover new resources. Lastly, NSSP assisted
    State Parks in setting up archaeological sites for volunteer site stewardship
    and advised them in creating a system for managing archaeological information
    and stewardship reports.

- description: 'BLM entered into two agreements to encourage the inventory, evaluation,
    and protection of unique archaeological resources in Lincoln County, Nevada. Projects
    included partnerships with the State Historic Preservation Office to improve the
    Lincoln County Site Stewardship Program and with The Nevada State Parks to improve
    preservation techniques for three historic ranches in Spring Valley State Park.


    Other projects awarded in previous years were also completed in FY23. For example,
    the Archaeology and Geomorphology Green Box project provided teachers for grades
    6-8 active learning strategies to engage students in hands-on projects that foster
    critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The Green Boxes are now available
    to teachers in Lincoln County and other schools to check-out and use during the
    semester to facilitate cultural resource education in the future. Another example
    of projects that were completed is the Lincoln County High project. The project
    inventoried cultural resources above 8,000 feet, Lincoln County High provides
    researchers site records that record game drives, cairns, and hunting blinds that
    document Native American hunting activities.'
