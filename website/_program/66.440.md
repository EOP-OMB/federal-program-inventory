objective: "The objective of EPA's Urban Waters Program is to protect and restore\
  \ America's urban waterways. EPA's funding priority is to achieve the goals and\
  \ commitments established in the Framework for the Future included in the 2021 Partner\
  \ Recommitment (https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-11/urban-waters-recommitment-report-112221_508.pdf).\
  \ This program has an emphasis on engaging communities with environmental justice\
  \ concerns. The objective of the Urban Waters Grants is to fund research, investigations,\
  \ experiments, training, surveys, studies, and demonstrations that will advance\
  \ the restoration of urban waters by improving water quality in urban areas through\
  \ activities that also support community revitalization and local priorities while\
  \ strengthening local capacity and increasing information exchange between urban\
  \ waters communities. This program recognizes that healthy and accessible urban\
  \ waters can help grow local businesses and enhance educational, recreational, social,\
  \ and employment opportunities in nearby communities.\n\nFunding Priority \u2013\
  \ Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA\u2019s funding priority for Urban Waters Grants is to continue\
  \ to support projects that will advance EPA\u2019s water quality and environmental\
  \ justice goals. The mission of EPA\u2019s Urban Waters Program is to help local\
  \ residents and their organizations, particularly those in underserved communities,\
  \ restore their urban waters in ways that also benefit community and economic revitalization.\
  \ Projects address urban water pollution through diverse partnerships that produce\
  \ multiple community benefits, with emphasis on underserved communities. In general,\
  \ projects should include one or more of the following priorities and actions: address\
  \ local water quality issues related to urban water pollution, climate resilience,\
  \ environmental justice, and/or equitable development; provide additional community\
  \ benefits; actively engage underserved communities; support capacity development\
  \ in underserved communities that coordinates partner activities to accelerate on\
  \ the ground progress; strengthen information exchange and learning opportunities\
  \ between urban waters practitioners; and foster partnerships."
