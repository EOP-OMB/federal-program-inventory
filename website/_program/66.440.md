objective: 'The objective of EPA''s Urban Waters Program is to protect and restore
  America''s urban waterways. EPA''s funding priority is to achieve the goals and
  commitments established in the Framework for the Future included in the 2021 Partner
  Recommitment (https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-11/urban-waters-recommitment-report-112221_508.pdf).
  This program has an emphasis on engaging communities with environmental justice
  concerns. The objective of the Urban Waters Grants is to fund research, investigations,
  experiments, training, surveys, studies, and demonstrations that will advance the
  restoration of urban waters by improving water quality in urban areas through activities
  that also support community revitalization and local priorities while strengthening
  local capacity and increasing information exchange between urban waters communities.
  This program recognizes that healthy and accessible urban waters can help grow local
  businesses and enhance educational, recreational, social, and employment opportunities
  in nearby communities.


  Funding Priority – Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA’s funding priority for Urban Waters Grants
  is to continue to support projects that will advance EPA’s water quality and environmental
  justice goals. The mission of EPA’s Urban Waters Program is to help local residents
  and their organizations, particularly those in underserved communities, restore
  their urban waters in ways that also benefit community and economic revitalization.
  Projects address urban water pollution through diverse partnerships that produce
  multiple community benefits, with emphasis on underserved communities. In general,
  projects should include one or more of the following priorities and actions: address
  local water quality issues related to urban water pollution, climate resilience,
  environmental justice, and/or equitable development; provide additional community
  benefits; actively engage underserved communities; support capacity development
  in underserved communities that coordinates partner activities to accelerate on
  the ground progress; strengthen information exchange and learning opportunities
  between urban waters practitioners; and foster partnerships.'
