objective: "To assist States (including territories and the District of Columbia),\
  \ Indian Tribes qualified under CWA Section 518(e), and interstate agencies in establishing\
  \ and maintaining adequate measures for prevention and control of surface and ground\
  \ water pollution from both point and nonpoint sources.  Funding Priority - Fiscal\
  \ year 2023: \n States and Tribes will continue to focus on fulfilling their basic\
  \ responsibilities under the CWA Section 106 funded programs. State priority efforts\
  \ will include: (1) implementing monitoring strategies and the statistically-valid\
  \ surveys to determine water quality status and trends; (2) fostering a watershed\
  \ approach, including total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and watershed plans designed\
  \ to meet water quality standards; (3) implementing National Pollutant Discharge\
  \ Elimination System (NPDES) permitting programs; and 4) States and Tribes will\
  \ continue adopting updated water quality standards that support designated uses\
  \ and completing triennial reviews on time.  States NPDES Programs will continue\
  \ to: (1) ensure the integrity of the program; (2) achieve and measure environmental\
  \ results; and (3) incorporate efficiencies in permitting program operations. States\
  \ will also conduct source water protection actions to protect both ground water\
  \ and surface waters used for drinking water. Tribes will continue to conduct watershed\
  \ assessments and will maintain and improve their capacity to implement water quality\
  \ programs through monitoring, assessments, planning, data management and standards\
  \ development.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024: States and Tribes will continue\
  \ to focus on fulfilling their basic responsibilities under the CWA Section 106\
  \ funded programs. State priority efforts will include: (1) implementing monitoring\
  \ strategies and the statistically-valid surveys to determine water quality status\
  \ and trends; (2) fostering a watershed approach, including total maximum daily\

- description: 'In each fiscal year, grants are awarded to conduct Water Pollution
    Control programs by the 50 States, 6 Territories, the District of Columbia, 6
    Interstate Commissions, and Indian Tribes qualifying under CWA Section 518(e).
    FY 16 funds will be used to continue to support State and Tribes'' efforts to
    fulfill their basic responsibilities under the CWA and identify program activities
    that best support attaining targeted environmental improvements. States and tribes
    continued working on: implementing monitoring strategies and the development of
    statistically-valid surveys to determine water quality status and trends; fostering
    a watershed approach including total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and the development
    of watershed plans designed to meeting water quality standards; and the implementation
    of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and storm water permitting programs.
    At a minimum, Regional watershed based strategies give priority to: 1) fostering
    the development of watershed plans under State nonpoint source programs; 2) assuring
    that high priority permits are current; 3) tracking permitting for environmental
    results program integrity follow-up actions; 4) developing TMDLs for impaired
    waters; and 5) development of numeric criteria for nutrients. In Fiscal Year 2016,
    5 grants for approximately $26 million were awarded. Projects funded included
    new and expanded wastewater treatment plants, infiltration/inflow correction,
    stormwater projects, new collector sewers, nutrient removal, new and rehabilitated
    sewer lines, and green infrastructure. '
