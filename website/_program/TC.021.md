objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In
  contrast, the Tax Code provides for the issuance of Clean Renewable Energy Bonds
  that entitle the bond holder to a Federal income tax credit in lieu of interest.
  As of March 2010, issuers of the unused authorization of such bonds could opt to
  receive direct payment with the yield becoming fully taxable.
