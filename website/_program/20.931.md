- description: 'Conducted applied research in commercial remote sensing and spatial
    information technologies for application to national transportation infrastructure
    development and construction. The Program investigated, developed and validated
    new applications and provided products to monitor and assess infrastructure condition
    of bridges, pavements and other transportation infrastructure. In addition, the
    Program developed remote sensing applications to optimize freight movements in
    urban areas and in and around ports. Spatial information technologies, such as
    GIS and GPS systems, were deployed to assist in these research investigations.  Conducted
