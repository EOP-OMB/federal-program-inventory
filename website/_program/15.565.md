objective: "The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 was signed into law on December 8, 2010,\
  \ authorizing the settlement of two long-running New Mexico Indian water rights\
  \ cases.  Title V, the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, authorizes\
  \ implementation of the Abeyta (Taos Pueblo) settlement.  The Settlement Act authorizes\
  \ and directs the Bureau of Reclamation to provide financial assistance in the form\
  \ of grants on a non-reimbursable basis to plan, permit, design, engineer, and construct\
  \ Mutual-Benefit Projects that will minimize adverse effects on the Pueblo’s water\
  \ resources by moving future non-Indian ground water pumping away from the Pueblo’s\
  \ Buffalo Pasture, a culturally sensitive wetland.  The Federal Team is working\
  \ with the Mutual-Benefit Project parties as they get ready for the on-the-ground\
  \ phase of settlement implementation. Reclamation’s Albuquerque Area Office is in\
  \ the process of completing environmental compliance and awarding grants to the\
  \ entities that are moving forward with their projects.\r\n\r\nThe overall cost\
  \ of the settlement is $144 million, of which $124 million would be paid by the\
  \ Federal government and $20 million by the State of New Mexico. The total federal\
  \ contribution of $124 million includes $88.0 million directed to the Bureau of\
  \ Indian Affairs for the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund, and a $36 million settlement\
  \ fund ($16 million mandatory and $20 million discretionary funds) directed to Reclamation\
  \ for the Mutual-Benefit Projects."

results:
- description: The first grant for $4M was awarded in FY17, and at least one more
    grant should be awarded early in FY18.  There are questions that will need to
    be resolved about who would own and operate certain projects before some of the
    Mutual-Benefit Project entities will be ready to apply for their grants, as a
    few have indicated that they are not interested in applying for funding or constructing
    their project. Additionally, the Federal Team was informed in October 2017 that
    some project locations may need to be reassessed due to hydrogeologic concerns.
    The parties will have to work together to resolve these issues. In the meantime,
    the Federal Team will continue to support efforts to move forward with settlement
    implementation, and Reclamation will continue to award grants as project entities
    apply for their funding.
