objective: "The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 was signed into law on December 8, 2010,\
  \ authorizing the settlement of two long-running New Mexico Indian water rights\
  \ cases.  Title V, the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, authorizes\
  \ implementation of the Abeyta (Taos Pueblo) settlement.  The Settlement Act authorizes\
  \ and directs the Bureau of Reclamation to provide financial assistance in the form\
  \ of grants on a non-reimbursable basis to plan, permit, design, engineer, and construct\
  \ Mutual-Benefit Projects that will minimize adverse effects on the Pueblo\u2019\
  s water resources by moving future non-Indian ground water pumping away from the\
  \ Pueblo\u2019s Buffalo Pasture, a culturally sensitive wetland.  The Federal Team\
  \ is working with the Mutual-Benefit Project parties as they get ready for the on-the-ground\
  \ phase of settlement implementation. Reclamation\u2019s Albuquerque Area Office\
  \ is in the process of completing environmental compliance and awarding grants to\
  \ the entities that are moving forward with their projects.\r\n\r\nThe overall cost\
  \ of the settlement is $144 million, of which $124 million would be paid by the\
  \ Federal government and $20 million by the State of New Mexico. The total federal\
  \ contribution of $124 million includes $88.0 million directed to the Bureau of\
  \ Indian Affairs for the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund, and a $36 million settlement\
  \ fund ($16 million mandatory and $20 million discretionary funds) directed to Reclamation\
  \ for the Mutual-Benefit Projects."
