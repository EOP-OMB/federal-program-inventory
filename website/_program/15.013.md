objective: "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and\
  \ energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states, and the\
  \ Native Alaskan/Native American communities. The BOEM oversees the exploration\
  \ and development of oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives\
  \ on the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). BOEM continues to look for better\
  \ ways to serve the American people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best\
  \ value for its resources now and into the future. The program not only supports\
  \ decisions made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal\
  \ states and local governments with the information necessary to ensure that all\
  \  stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted in a  manner to\
  \ protect both the human and natural environments. Through this cooperative agreement,\
  \ training and learning opportunities will be provided to young people in order\
  \ to develop the next generation of lifelong conservation stewards and protect,\
  \ restore, and enhance America\u2019s Great Outdoors.\nSpecifically, this cooperative\
  \ agreement will give students the opportunity to learn about the importance of\
  \ the BOEM mission to manage the development of US Outer Continental Shelf energy\
  \ and mineral resources in an environmentally, economically, and social conscious\
  \ way while exploring future career options with BOEM. Assignments will be designed\
  \ to provide orientation and experience in the practical application of the theories,\
  \ concepts and principles of petroleum engineering, geology, geophysics, and/or\
  \ environmental science.\nThe Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP)\
  \ is designated as tax exempt under the IRS for Institutions of Higher Education.\
  \ ANSEP moves Native American and Alaskan Native students into science, technology,\
  \ engineering and mathematics degree programs, and fosters a stronger Indigenous\
  \ American representation within the science workforce of BOEM. Established in 1995,\
  \ ANSEP has evolved into a longitudinal education model that provides a continuous\
  \ string of components beginning with students in sixth grade and continuing through\
  \ high school, into science and engineering\n \nundergraduate and graduate degree\
  \ programs through PhD. ANSEP has received numerous recognitions for successfully\
  \ preparing students for professional science and engineering careers including\
  \ the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Minorities in Energy Initiative, the U.S.\
  \ Department of the Interior Partners in Conservation Award, and the Ash Center\
  \ for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Harvard University-Top 25 Innovations\
  \ in Government. ANSEP, through this cooperative agreement, provides an opportunity\
  \ to further engage Alaska\u2019s Native professionals, and develop the future scientific\
  \ and engineering employment pool required to support the BOEM mission. The overall\
  \ objective is to expand the professional science employment preparedness of ANSEP\
  \ students and to develop a more diversified pool of highly educated professionals\
  \ with the BOEM workforce to reflect the rich diversity of the Nation."
