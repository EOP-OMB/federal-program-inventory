objective: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and
  energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states, and the
  Native Alaskan/Native American communities. The BOEM oversees the exploration and
  development of oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives
  on the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). BOEM continues to look for better
  ways to serve the American people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best
  value for its resources now and into the future. The program not only supports decisions
  made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal states and
  local governments with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore
  energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner to protect both the human
  and natural environments. Through this cooperative agreement, training and learning
  opportunities will be provided to young people in order to develop the next generation
  of lifelong conservation stewards and protect, restore, and enhance America’s Great
  Outdoors. Specifically, this cooperative agreement will give students the opportunity
  to learn about the importance of the BOEM mission to manage the development of US
  Outer Continental Shelf energy and mineral resources in an environmentally, economically,
  and social conscious way while exploring future career options with BOEM. Assignments
  will be designed to provide orientation and experience in the practical application
  of the theories, concepts and principles of petroleum engineering, geology, geophysics,
  and/or environmental science. The Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program
  (ANSEP) is designated as tax exempt under the IRS for Institutions of Higher Education.
  ANSEP moves Native American and Alaskan Native students into science, technology,
  engineering and mathematics degree programs, and fosters a stronger Indigenous American
  representation within the science workforce of BOEM. Established in 1995, ANSEP
  has evolved into a longitudinal education model that provides a continuous string
  of components beginning with students in sixth grade and continuing through high
  school, into science and engineering undergraduate and graduate degree programs
  through PhD. ANSEP has received numerous recognitions for successfully preparing
  students for professional science and engineering careers including the U.S. Department
  of Energy’s Minorities in Energy Initiative, the U.S. Department of the Interior
  Partners in Conservation Award, and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and
  Innovation, Harvard University-Top 25 Innovations in Government. ANSEP, through
  this cooperative agreement, provides an opportunity to further engage Alaska’s Native
  professionals, and develop the future scientific and engineering employment pool
  required to support the BOEM mission. The overall objective is to expand the professional
  science employment preparedness of ANSEP students and to develop a more diversified
  pool of highly educated professionals with the BOEM workforce to reflect the rich
  diversity of the Nation.
