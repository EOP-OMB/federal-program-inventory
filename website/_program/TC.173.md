objective: Under the baseline tax system, a deduction for personal consumption expenditures
  would not be allowed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who itemize their
  deductions to claim a deduction for State and local income taxes (or, at the taxpayerâ€™s
  election, State and local sales taxes) and property taxes, even though these taxes
  primarily pay for services that, if purchased directly by taxpayers, would not be
  deductible. (The estimates for this tax expenditure do not include the estimates
  for the deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes, which
  are presented in provision number 62.) In the case of taxable years beginning after
  December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, (1) the deduction for foreign real
  property taxes paid is disallowed and (2) the deduction for taxes paid in any taxable
  year, which includes the deduction for property taxes on real property, is limited
  to $10,000 ($5,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return).
