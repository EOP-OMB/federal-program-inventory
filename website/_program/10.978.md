objective: "USDA is offering a grant program focused on addressing labor shortages\
  \ in agriculture, reducing irregular migration through expansion of legal pathways,\
  \ and improving labor protections for farmworkers in order to improve the resiliency\
  \ of our food and agricultural supply chain. . Furthermore, The program aims to\
  \ improve the resiliency of our food and agricultural supply chain and advance several\
  \ major administration priorities: \n\nDriving U.S. economic recovery and safeguarding\
  \ domestic food security by addressing current labor shortages in agriculture. Even\
  \ before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, agricultural employers were struggling\
  \ to secure a stable workforce. The pandemic has only exacerbated this problem,\
  \ threatening our domestic capacity to produce a safe and robust food supply. This\
  \ pilot program will help address this shortage by expanding the potential pool\
  \ of workers.\nReducing irregular migration through the expansion of legal pathways.\
  \ The Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous steps to address the elevated\
  \ levels of irregular migration from Northern Central America. The H-2A visa program\
  \ offers a lawful pathway for individuals from these countries to come to the United\
  \ States to engage in temporary or seasonal agricultural work. An effective H-2A\
  \ visa program is critical to the resiliency of the food and agricultural supply\
  \ chain. This pilot program will aim to address challenges that both workers and\
  \ employers face in utilizing the program.\nImproving working conditions for farmworkers.\
  \ Strong working conditions are critical to the resiliency of the food and agricultural\
  \ supply chain. Through this pilot program, USDA will support efforts to improve\
  \ working conditions for both U.S. and H-2A workers and ensure that H-2A workers\
  \ are not subjected to unfair recruitment practices."
