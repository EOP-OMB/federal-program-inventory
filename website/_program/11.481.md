objective: To continue development of education, research, policy and natural resource
  management programs aimed at increasing education, training and graduation rates
  in NOAA mission STEM disciplines at Minority Serving Institutions. All EPP/MSI program
  components are awarded through national competitive processes. Partnerships and
  capacity building are achieved through collaboration with NOAA scientists and managers
  and with the use of NOAA facilities and resources in atmospheric, oceanic, environmental
  sciences, and remote sensing technologies.

    \   136 number of students trained in NOAA mission research;\r\n86 number of collaborative\
    \ research projects conducted with NOAA scientists & managers;\r\n1 number of\

    include 2 summer internships hosted by various NOAA offices and programs.
  year: '2019'
- description: "The Cooperative Science Center awards expanded higher education access\
    \ for students from communities historically excluded from careers in the NOAA-mission\
    \ enterprise.   They supported 363 students of which 63 graduated with undergraduate\
    \ degrees (39) or graduate degrees (20 Master's and 4 doctoral).   In addition,\
    \ 3 CSC graduates entered the NOAA mission enterprise workforce as Federal employees\
    \ or contractors - others are pursuing higher degrees and or in the workforce\
    \ in academia, private sector and state agencies.  \nThe CSCs increased the  number\
    \ of post-secondary students trained with core competencies relevant to the NOAA-mission\
    \ workforce, including: increased quantitative and analytical skills; increased\
    \ competence in applying STEM to decision making, policy, and management; and\
    \ increased skills to use large data sets, geographical information systems and\
    \ statistical analysis, computer modeling, and algorithm development.\nAlthough\
    \ the COVID-19 pandemic impacted access to NOAA offices, CSC graduate students\
    \ completed virtual graduate internships with NOAA scientists and other professionals\
    \ serving as mentors.\nCSC students and faculty published 59 refereed journal\
    \ articles, 4 books, 6 book chapters and made over 100 presentations at national\
    \ and regional meetings, on campuses. All presentations, after March 2020, were\
    \ in virtual settings."

- description: In fiscal year 2021, The EPP/MSI program supported 4 Cooperative Science
    Centers and 24 institutions. The program provided them financial assistance, through
    competitive processes, to train over 250 graduate students to conduct research
    in NOAA mission sciences (the program aims to increase the number of students,
    particularly from underrepresented groups, who are trained and earn degrees in
    sciences directly related to NOAA's mission).  Additionally, the program provided
    two-year academic scholarships to 32 undergraduate students; the program also
    supported them as they completed two 10-week internships at NOAA facilities.

- description: In fiscal year 2022, the EPP/MSI program provided financial assistance
    to 4 Cooperative Science Centers comprising 24 institutions. The program provided
    financial assistance, through competitive processes, to train over 87 graduate
    students to complete coursework and conduct research in NOAA mission-aligned sciences.
    (The program aims to increase the number of students, particularly from underrepresented
    groups, who are trained and earn degrees in sciences directly related to NOAA's

- description: In fiscal year 2023, The EPP/MSI program provided financial assistance
    to 4 Cooperative Science Centers comprising 24 institutions. The program provided
    financial assistance to support the training of over 88 graduate students to complete
    coursework and conduct research in NOAA mission-aligned sciences.  This future
    workforce STEM program aims to increase the number of students, particularly from
    communities underrepresented in NOAA mission-aligned sciences, who are trained
    and earn degrees in science, resource management, engineering, and policy directly
    aligned to NOAA's mission. Additionally, the program provided two-year academic
    scholarships, which included two 10-week internships at NOAA facilities, to 44
    undergraduate students.
