objective: To continue development of education, research, policy and natural resource
  management programs aimed at increasing education, training and graduation rates
  in NOAA mission STEM disciplines at Minority Serving Institutions. All EPP/MSI program
  components are awarded through national competitive processes. Partnerships and
  capacity building are achieved through collaboration with NOAA scientists and managers
  and with the use of NOAA facilities and resources in atmospheric, oceanic, environmental
  sciences, and remote sensing technologies.

results:
- description: In fiscal year 2022, the EPP/MSI program provided financial assistance
    to 4 Cooperative Science Centers comprising 24 institutions. The program provided
    financial assistance, through competitive processes, to train over 87 graduate
    students to complete coursework and conduct research in NOAA mission-aligned sciences.
    (The program aims to increase the number of students, particularly from underrepresented
    groups, who are trained and earn degrees in sciences directly related to NOAA's
    mission.) Additionally, the program provided two-year academic scholarships, which
    included two 10-week internships at NOAA facilities, to 32 undergraduate students.

- description: In fiscal year 2023, The EPP/MSI program provided financial assistance
    to 4 Cooperative Science Centers comprising 24 institutions. The program provided
    financial assistance to support the training of over 88 graduate students to complete
    coursework and conduct research in NOAA mission-aligned sciences.  This future
    workforce STEM program aims to increase the number of students, particularly from
    communities underrepresented in NOAA mission-aligned sciences, who are trained
    and earn degrees in science, resource management, engineering, and policy directly
    aligned to NOAA's mission. Additionally, the program provided two-year academic
    scholarships, which included two 10-week internships at NOAA facilities, to 44
    undergraduate students.
