  year: '2022'
- description: "Total apprentices served reflecting the diversity of America’s available\
    \ workforce – 860,066. Total Annual Number of Apprentices served from underserved\
    \ communities – 426,301. Data and Statistics Enhancement: Office of Apprenticeship\
    \ published a dashboard with disaggregated data publicly on apprenticeship.gov\
    \ through the Department’s Enterprise Data Platform. The Enterprise Data Platform\
    \ (EDP) integrates data from existing reporting and case management systems (Registered\
    \ Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System – RAPIDS). This modern analytics-focused\
    \ architecture connects internal and external data sets (mix of structured and\
    \ unstructured data) to support diverse use cases for legacy data analysis, ongoing\
    \ statistical, routine business reporting, trend and pattern evaluation, for participants\
    \ in registered apprenticeship. The platform enables users to disaggregate data\
    \ by race and ethnicity, industry, occupation, from a state or national perspective.\
    \ Future enhancements of the tool will incorporate investment data for strategic\
    \ growth targeting where effort should be prioritized to grow registered apprenticeships.\n\
    \nThe U.S. Department of Labor awarded nearly $195m in Apprenticeship Building\
    \ America, Round 2 (ABA2) grants to 43 grantees including but not limited to Institutes\
    \ of Higher Education, Community Based Organizations, Nonprofit Organizations,\
    \ Workforce Development System Entities, State Education Agencies, and a Labor\
    \ Union. ABA2 builds on efforts funded under the first round of the ABA grants\
    \ awarded in 2022, which continues to expand, diversify, and strengthen the Registered\
    \ Apprenticeship system through support for public/private partnerships designed\
    \ to serve a range of industries and individuals. Through the ABA2 grant program,\
    \ grantees will work with industry, including employers, labor unions, and other\
    \ stakeholders to leverage the development of RAPs to help bolster the workforce\
    \ and meet industry talent needs, particularly in sectors that align with President\
    \ Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, including historic legislation passed by\
    \ Congress and signed into law by President Biden such as the American Rescue\
    \ Plan Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Creating Helpful Incentives to\
    \ Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act\
    \ (IRA). \n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor also awarded nearly $89m in State Apprenticeship\
    \ Expansion Formula Grants, Round 2 (SAEF2) to states and territories to increase\
    \ their ability to expand, diversify, and modernize the National Apprenticeship\
    \ system. These awards fund the second year of a five-year apprenticeship investment\
    \ plan for states and territories to increase their ability to serve, improve,\
    \ and strategically expand Registered Apprenticeship programs. Awards include\
    \ annual formula funding to 46 states and territories and additional funding to\
    \ 9 states committed to increasing sustainability and substantially increasing\
    \ the total number and diversity of Registered Apprentices and RAPs within their\
    \ State. This funding builds on the Administration’s commitment to expand the\
    \ registered apprenticeship system to reward work, rebuild the middle class, and\
    \ connect a diverse workforce to family supporting, living wage jobs, while addressing\
    \ systemic barriers to equity, justice, education, excellence, economic opportunity,\
    \ and equality faced by underrepresented and underserved populations."
