    \ workforce – 846,857. \nTotal Annual Number of Apprentices served from underserved\
    \ communities – 398,110.   \nData and Statistics Enhancement: Office of Apprenticeship\
    \ published a dashboard with disaggregated data publicly on apprenticeship.gov\
    \ through the Department’s Enterprise Data Platform. The Enterprise Data Platform\
    \ (EDP) integrates data from existing reporting and case management systems (Registered\
    \ Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System – RAPIDS). This modern analytics-focused\
    \ architecture connects internal and external data sets (mix of structured and\
    \ unstructured data) to support diverse use cases for legacy data analysis, ongoing\
    \ statistical, routine business reporting, trend and pattern evaluation, for participants\
    \ in registered apprenticeship. The platform enables users to disaggregate data\
    \ by race and ethnicity, industry, occupation, from a state or national perspective.\
    \ \nFuture enhancements of the tool will incorporate investment data for strategic\
    \ growth targeting where effort should be prioritized to grow registered apprenticeships.\n\
    \nAwarded 45 State Apprenticeship Expansion Formula (SAEF) grants as part of a\
    \ five-year investment plan, for States to support State capacity and State planning\
    \ to create new and expand existing Registered Apprenticeship Programs while also\
    \ driving system innovation and reform. Subject to available funding, the Department\
    \ intends to provide, on an on-going basis, an annual formula-funded base grant\
    \ to all States that apply and that meet application requirements, as well as\
    \ an opportunity for States to apply for additional Competitive Funding annually.\

    \ upon funding remaining available over the next five years. 45 states received\
    \ base funding, of those 7 states also received competitive funds. Base funding\
    \ amounts range between $300,000 and $1,500,000. Competitive funding amounts range\
    \ between $3,000,000 and $6,000,000. Awarded TradesFutures, a 501c3 organization,\

    \ the number of participants from underrepresented populations and underserved\
    \ communities in registered apprenticeship programs within the construction industry\
    \ sector. Through a cooperative agreement with the Department, this project will\
    \ leverage a unique and proven apprenticeship readiness curriculum (Multi-Craft\
    \ Core Curriculum or MC3) for construction trades, a dynamic partnership model,\
    \ and the ability for national reach for union placement opportunities for program\
    \ graduates."
