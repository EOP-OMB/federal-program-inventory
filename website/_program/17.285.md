objective: 'This grant funding will help integrate Registered Apprenticeship into
  the mainstream as a viable career pathway option to help the country build the strongest,
  most adaptable and most credentialed workforce in the world.  Grants to states and
  public-private partnerships work to expand the number of apprentices and registered
  apprenticeship programs nationwide, reaching traditional and non-traditional industries,
  such as I.T., healthcare and cybersecurity, and ensuring registered apprenticeship
  opportunities reach underrepresented populations in apprenticeship including youth,
  women, minorities, U.S. Veterans, including transitioning service members, and persons
  with disabilities. Cross-cutting principles are supported in grant programs to ensure
  quality jobs for all workers: Equity; Job Quality; High-Quality, sustainable programs;
  Evidence-based approaches; and

  New opportunities for innovation, engagement, and ease of access.'
