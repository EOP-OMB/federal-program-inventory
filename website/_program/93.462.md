objective: This program provides an opportunity to strengthen and expand the ability
  of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) to support public health agencies in communities
  and states. There is a clear need for new data and new approaches for public health
  programs, including approaches made possible by modern computing. For example, case
  investigation and contact tracing can be augmented by new data and new approaches
  to better identify the sources of a disease and help prevent additional outbreaks.
