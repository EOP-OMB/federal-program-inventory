results:
- description: The Healthy Homes Technical Studies program produces research results
    that enable to the OLHCHH to make scientifically sound recommendations on housing-related
    health and safety hazard issues.  For example, while screening is intuitively
    beneficial, justifying the cost requires determining not only the primary effect,
    on the quantitative presence of female Aedes mosquitoes inside intervention homes
    compared to control homes, but also consequent effects, such as of virus human
    infection of any severity, and insights into acceptability and cost of such interventions,
    for policy decisions to be defined and supported.
