objective: "The overall goal of the Targeted Airshed Grant program is to reduce air\
  \ pollution in the nation\u2019s nonattainment areas with the highest levels of\
  \ ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) ambient air concentrations.\n\nFunding\
  \ Priorities: Fiscal Year 2023: The Targeted Airshed Grant Program will fund activities\
  \ in applicable nonattainment areas that will achieve documentable reductions of\
  \ emissions that contribute to ozone and/or direct PM2.5 concentrations in the applicable\
  \ nonattainment areas. Pollutants contributing to ozone concentrations are nitrous\
  \ oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Pollutants contributing to\
  \ PM2.5 concentrations are direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors NOx, VOCs, sulfur dioxide\
  \ (SO2), and ammonia."
