objective: 'The overall goal of the Targeted Airshed Grant program is to reduce air
  pollution in the nationâ€™s nonattainment areas with the highest levels of ozone and
  fine particulate matter (PM2.5) ambient air concentrations.


  Funding Priorities: Fiscal Year 2023: The Targeted Airshed Grant Program will fund
  activities in applicable nonattainment areas that will achieve documentable reductions
  of emissions that contribute to ozone and/or direct PM2.5 concentrations in the
  applicable nonattainment areas. Pollutants contributing to ozone concentrations
  are nitrous oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Pollutants contributing
  to PM2.5 concentrations are direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors NOx, VOCs, sulfur
  dioxide (SO2), and ammonia.'
