objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However,
  under current law taxpayers who invest in certain low-income housing projects are
  eligible for a tax credit. The credit rate is set so that the present value of the
  credit is equal to at least 70 percent of the buildingâ€™s qualified basis for new
  construction and 30 percent for (1) housing receiving other Federal benefits (such
  as tax-exempt bond financing) or (2) substantially rehabilitated existing housing.
  The credit can exceed these levels in certain statutorily defined and State designated
  areas where project development costs are higher. The credit is allowed in equal
  amounts over 10 years and is generally subject to a volume cap.
