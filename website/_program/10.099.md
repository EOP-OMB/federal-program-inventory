objective: "To provide access to credit for farmers who need and want to implement\
  \ conservation measures on their land but do not have the \u201Cup front\u201D funds\
  \ available to implement these practices. Unlike FSA\u2019s traditional farm ownership\
  \ and operating loan programs that are targeted toward smaller and less financially\
  \ established farmers, eligibility requirements for the CL program are expanded\
  \ to permit FSA to provide assistance to some applicants who may be large and financially\
  \ strong."
