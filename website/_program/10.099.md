objective: To provide access to credit for farmers who need and want to implement
  conservation measures on their land but do not have the “up front” funds available
  to implement these practices. Unlike FSA’s traditional farm ownership and operating
  loan programs that are targeted toward smaller and less financially established
  farmers, eligibility requirements for the CL program are expanded to permit FSA
  to provide assistance to some applicants who may be large and financially strong.
