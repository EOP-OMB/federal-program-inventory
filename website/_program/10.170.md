objective: 'The U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service
  (AMS) implements the Specialty Crop Block Grants through the Specialty Crop Block
  Grant Program (SCBGP) and the Specialty Crop Multi-State Program (SCMP) to enhance
  the competitiveness of specialty crops. Specialty crops are defined as fruits, vegetables,
  tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops (including floriculture).
  The SCBGP issues non-competitive, formula grants to state departments of agriculture
  for the purposes of leveraging efforts to market and promote specialty crops; assisting
  producers with research and development relevant to specialty crops; expanding availability
  and access to specialty crops; and addressing local, regional, and national challenges
  confronting specialty crop producers. SCMP competitively awards funds for collaborative,
  multi-state projects that address the following regional or national level specialty
  crop issues: food safety, plant pests and disease, research, crop-specific projects
  addressing common issues, and marketing.'
