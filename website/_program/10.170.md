objective: "The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing\
  \ Service (AMS) implements the Specialty Crop Block Grants through the Specialty\
  \ Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) and the Specialty Crop Multi-State Program (SCMP)\
  \ to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops. Specialty crops are defined\
  \ as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops\
  \ (including floriculture). The SCBGP issues non-competitive, formula grants to\
  \ state departments of agriculture for the purposes of leveraging efforts to market\
  \ and promote specialty crops; assisting producers with research and development\
  \ relevant to specialty crops; expanding availability and access to specialty crops;\
  \ and addressing local, regional, and national challenges confronting specialty\
  \ crop producers. SCMP competitively awards funds for collaborative, multi-state\
  \ projects that address the following regional or national level specialty crop\
  \ issues: food safety, plant pests and disease, research, crop-specific projects\
  \ addressing common issues, and marketing."
