objective: 'To assist States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern
  Marianas, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands (hereinafter referred to as States), and qualified
  Indian Tribes and intertribal consortia in implementing EPA-approved Section 319
  nonpoint source management programs.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: EPA''s funding priority is to award grants
  that implement a grant recipient''s nonpoint source management program plan, particularly
  the development and implementation of watershed-based plans, focusing on watersheds
  with water quality impairments caused by nonpoint sources, which result in improved
  water quality in impaired waters. These watershed plans are a mechanism to coordinate
  monitoring and planning on a watershed basis and will build a foundation for effective
  implementation actions using federal and other funding. Nonpoint source implementation
  projects include best management practice (BMP) installation for animal wastes,
  sediment, pesticide and fertilizer control, a variety of other structural and non-structural
  practices, watershed planning, monitoring, watershed coordinators, technology demonstration,
  and a variety of education/outreach programs, among others.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024:  EPA''s funding priority will continue to award
  grants that implement a grant recipient''s nonpoint source management program plan,
  particularly the development and implementation of watershed-based plans, focusing
  on watersheds with water quality impairments caused by nonpoint sources, which result
  in improved water quality in impaired waters. These watershed plans are a mechanism
  to coordinate monitoring and planning on a watershed basis and will build a foundation
  for effective implementation actions using federal and other funding.   Nonpoint
  source implementation projects include best management practice (BMP) installation
  for animal wastes, sediment, pesticide and fertilizer control, a variety of other
