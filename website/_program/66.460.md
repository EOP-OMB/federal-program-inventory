objective: To assist States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern
  Marianas, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands (hereinafter referred to as States), and qualified
  Indian Tribes and intertribal consortia in implementing EPA-approved Section 319
  nonpoint source management programs. EPA's  awards grants that implement a grant
  recipient's nonpoint source management program plan, particularly the development
  and implementation of watershed-based plans, focusing on watersheds with water quality
  impairments caused by nonpoint sources, which result in improved water quality in
  impaired waters. These watershed plans are a mechanism to coordinate monitoring
  and planning on a watershed basis and will build a foundation for effective implementation
  actions using federal and other funding. Nonpoint source implementation projects
  include best management practice (BMP) installation for animal wastes, sediment,
  pesticide and fertilizer control, a variety of other structural and non-structural
  practices, watershed planning, monitoring, watershed coordinators, technology demonstration,
  and a variety of education/outreach programs, among others.
