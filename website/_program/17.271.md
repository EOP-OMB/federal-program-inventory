objective: This federal tax credit was designed to help individuals from certain targeted
  groups who consistently face significant barriers to employment move from economic
  dependency to self-sufficiency. Businesses are encouraged to hire targeted group
  members in order to claim the tax credit against wages paid to eligible new hire(s)
  during their first year of employment. WOTC joins other workforce programs that
  incentivize workplace diversity and facilitate access to good jobs for American
  workers.
