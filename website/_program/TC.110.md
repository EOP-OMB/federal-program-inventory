objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current law, however, interest
  earned on U.S. savings bonds issued after December 31, 1989, is tax-exempt if the
  bonds are transferred to an educational institution to pay for educational expenses.
  The tax exemption is phased out for taxpayers with AGI between $145,200 and 175,200
  if married filing jointly ($96,800 and $111,800 for other taxpayers) in 2023.
