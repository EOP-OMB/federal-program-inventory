objective: The purpose of this program is to coordinate the acceleration of countermeasure
  and product advanced research and development by—(A) facilitating collaboration
  between the Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies,
  relevant industries, academia, and other persons, with respect to such advanced
  research and development; (B) promoting countermeasure and product advanced research
  and development; (C) facilitating contacts between interested persons and the offices
  or employees authorized by the Secretary to advise such persons regarding requirements
  under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under section 351 of the Public
  Health Service Act; and (D) promoting innovation to reduce the time and cost of
  countermeasure and product advanced research and development.  The Public Health
  Service Act at 42 U.S.C. 247d-6a defines a qualified countermeasure as “…a drug
  (as that term is defined by section 321(g)(1) of title 21), biological product (as
  that term is defined by section 262(i) of this title), or device (as that term is
  defined by section 321(h) of title 21), that the Secretary determines to be a priority
  (consistent with sections 182(2) and 184(a) of title 6) to - (i) diagnose, mitigate,
  prevent, or treat harm from any biological agent (including organisms that cause
  an infectious disease) or toxin, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent that may
  cause a public health emergency affecting national security; or (ii) diagnose, mitigate,
  prevent, or treat harm from a condition that may result in adverse health consequences
  or death and may be caused by administering a drug, biological product, or device
  that is used as described in this subparagraph”
