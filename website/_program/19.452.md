objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement\
  \ is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society – including\
  \ young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ – increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans.  \n\nThe purpose of International Exchange\
  \ Alumni Programs is  to advance U.S. foreign policy by building and maintaining\
  \ relationships with current and future leaders, including Americans, who have participated\
  \ in international exchanges.  Alumni engagement is an integral component of the\
  \ U.S. Department of State’s public diplomacy that generates maximum return on the\
  \ U.S. government’s investment in exchange programs.  Alumni programs aim to unite\
  \ alumni communities around the globe and foster post-exchange opportunities through\
  \ follow-on activities, virtual engagement, funding opportunities and resources,\
  \ and regional programs."
