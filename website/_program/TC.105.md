objective: The baseline tax system accepts current law’s general rule limiting taxpayers’
  ability to deduct non-business interest expenses. In contrast, taxpayers may claim
  an above-the-line deduction of up to $2,500 on interest paid on an education loan.
  In 2023, the maximum deduction is phased down ratably for taxpayers with modified
  AGI between $165,000 and $195,000 if married filing jointly ($80,000 and $95,000
  for other taxpayers). Married individuals filing separate returns cannot claim the
  deduction.
