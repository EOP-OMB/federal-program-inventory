objective: This is a cooperative agreement program that will support entities providing
  outreach and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers on the ERP 2022 disaster
  assistance program. These agreements are intended to provide outreach and technical
  assistance on the Emergency Relief Program 2022 (a Farm Service Agency disaster
  assistance program) to producers, with a targeted focus on communities where outreach
  efforts have not been effective in the past and where participation in FSA programs
  has been historically lower.
