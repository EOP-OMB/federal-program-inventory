objective: "The objective of the FY 2023 HSGP is to fund SLTT efforts to prevent terrorism\n\
  and prepare the Nation for threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the\n\
  security of the United States.\n\nThe objective of the FY 2023 THSGP is to provide\
  \ funding directly to eligible tribes to strengthen their capacities to prevent,\
  \ prepare for, protect against, and respond to potential terrorist attacks.\n\n\
  HSGP consists of three components: the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), Urban\
  \ Area Security Initiative (UASI), and Operation Stonegarden (OPSG). SHSP supports\
  \ state, local, tribal, and territorial preparedness activities in efforts to build,\
  \ sustain, and deliver the capabilities necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect\
  \ against, mitigate, and respond to acts of terrorism. UASI assists high-threat,\
  \ high-density Urban Areas in efforts to build, sustain, and deliver the capabilities\
  \ necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate, and respond to acts\
  \ of terrorism. OPSG supports enhanced cooperation and coordination among Customs\
  \ and Border Protection (CBP), United States Border Patrol (USBP), and federal,\
  \ state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies. OPSG provides\
  \ funding to support joint efforts to secure the United States\u2019 borders along\
  \ routes of ingress from international borders to include travel corridors in states\
  \ bordering Mexico and Canada as well as states and territories with international\
  \ water borders. For FY 2023, DHS/FEMA will award SHSP and UASI funds based on DHS/FEMA\u2019\
  s relative risk methodology pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended.\
  \ The Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP) is a carve-out of SHSP. \n\n\
  Among the five basic homeland security missions noted in the DHS\nStrategic Plan\
  \ for Fiscal Years 2020-2024, both the HSGP and THSGP support the goal to Strengthen\
  \ National Preparedness and Resilience.\n\nPerformance Measures for FY 2023 are:\n\
  \nHSGP - SHSP and UASI/THSGP\n1.\tPercentage of funding allocated by the recipient\
  \ to core capabilities to build or\nsustain national priorities identified in the\
  \ Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO);\n2.\tPercentage of funding and projects\
  \ allocated by the recipient that align to\ncapability gaps identified through the\
  \ THIRA/SPR process;\n3.\tPercentage of projects identified by the recipient that\
  \ address a capability gap\nin a core capability that has a target(s) rated as high.\n\
  \nHSGP - OPSG:\n1.\tNumber of contacts that occurred as a result of OPSG deployments;\n\
  2.\tNumber of arrests that resulted from OPSG contacts;\n3.\tValue of drug seizures\
  \ that resulted from OPSG contacts."
