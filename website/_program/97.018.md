objective: 'To provide travel stipends (up to 75 percent of the expense of attendance)
  to fire service, emergency medical services,  and emergency managers attending National
  Fire Academy (NFA) courses at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) in Emmitsburg,
  Maryland. This assistance is provided by Public Law 93-498, Federal Fire Prevention
  and Control Act of 1974.   NFA curricula and programs are designed to support State
  and local response agencies to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, and respond to local,
  regional and national emergencies. Cost sharing for student attendance at NETC supports
  Goal 5 of the DHS Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 20-24, Strengthen Preparedness
  and Resilience; and Goal 3 of the FEMA Strategic Plan for FY 2022-2026, Promote
  and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation.


  NFA has a performance measure in place to measure the percentage of supervisors
  of students trained who believe their staff are better prepared as a result of NFA
  training.  For FY 2022, 93.3% of supervisors reported their staff was better prepared
  for natural and man-made emergencies.'
