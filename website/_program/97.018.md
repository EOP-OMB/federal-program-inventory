objective: 'To provide travel stipends (up to 75 percent of the expense of attendance)
  to fire service, emergency medical services,  and emergency managers attending National
  Fire Academy (NFA) courses at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) in Emmitsburg,
  Maryland. This assistance is provided by Public Law 93-498, Federal Fire Prevention
  and Control Act of 1974.   NFA curricula and programs are designed to support State
  and local response agencies to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, and respond to local,
  regional and national emergencies. Cost sharing for student attendance at NETC supports
  Goal 5 of the DHS Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 20-24, Strengthen Preparedness
  and Resilience; and Goal 3 of the FEMA Strategic Plan for FY 2022-2026, Promote
  and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation.


  NFA has a performance measure in place to measure the percentage of supervisors
  of students trained who believe their staff are better prepared as a result of NFA
  training.  For FY 2022, 93.3% of supervisors reported their staff was better prepared
  for natural and man-made emergencies.'

    through NFA-sponsored 2-, 6-, and 10-day on- and off-campus courses, State-sponsored
    2-, 6-, 10-day courses, and NFA Online distance learning courses. The number of
    students is lower than normal because all resident courses were canceled from
    March – September due to COVID-19.  Financial assistance/stipends were paid to
    2,007 students attending 129 resident 6- and 10-day course offerings at the NETC
    campus. With continued restrictions due to COVID-19, the NFA did not resume on-campus
    classes until April 12, 2021.  Only a limited number of stipends have been processed
    since classes just resumed.  It is anticipated that the amount paid to stipends
    will be significantly lower than previous years due to cancelation of courses
    until the April timeframe, and delivering courses for the remainder of the FY
    at 50% capacity.'
  year: '2020'
- description: 'Fiscal Year 2021: NFA trained 98,724 fire and emergency medical services
    personnel through NFA-sponsored 2-, 6-, and 10-day on- and off-campus courses,

    With continued restrictions due to COVID-19, the NFA did not resume delivering
    on-campus classes until April 12, 2021, with capacities for courses set at 50%.  This
    contributed to the lower number of students completing on-campus training. Financial
    assistance/stipends were paid to 1,029 students attending 131 resident 6- and
    10-day course offerings at the NETC campus.  During FY 21, in an effort to support

    on-campus classes.'
