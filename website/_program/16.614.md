objective: "The goal of the State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) initiative\
  \ is to support/address a priority of the DOJ to prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist\
  \ operations before they occur by integrating intelligence and law enforcement efforts\
  \ to achieve a coordinated response to terrorist threats. \n\nSLATT assists state,\
  \ local, and tribal law enforcement in identifying, investigating, and preventing\
  \ criminal acts of terror by providing training, technical assistance, and resources\
  \ – at the national level – that build law enforcement’s knowledge and capacity\
  \ to identify and respond to possible domestic terrorism.\n\nThe goal of SLATT is\
  \ accomplished through achieving the following programmatic objectives: \n• Increase\
  \ the knowledge and capacity of local, state, and tribal criminal justice practitioners\
  \ to detect, investigate, and interdict violent domestic terrorist acts through\
  \ training. \n• Increase the ability and capacity of criminal justice practitioners\
  \ to solve problems and improve policies/practices related to terrorism through\
  \ short-term and comprehensive technical assistance.\n• Increase the volume of information\
  \ provided to BJA and the criminal justice community.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:\
  \ Number of participants who\nsuccessfully completed the training;\n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 2: Percentage of participants trained and subsequently demonstrated performance\
  \ improvement; \n\nPerformance Measure 3: Number of curricula developed or updated;\
  \ and, \n\nPerformance Measure 4: Number of publications developed and disseminated."

    \ The program has produced various webinars and resources that are housed on a\

    \ media use by foreign-terrorist organizations with more than 170 attendees. Since\

    \ through SLATT.org, and more than 55,000 printed publications have been provided\
    \ to requesting agencies. \n\nWithin the last three fiscal years, the program\
    \ has been competed once, in FY 2018, and received two applications. One application\
    \ was funded.  Activities to be accomplished under the current SLATT award include\
    \ a significant updating and re-focus of the program towards the actual roles\
    \ and responsibilities of state and local law enforcement in our country’s larger\
    \ anti-terrorism effort. Training will be expanded from two course offerings to\
    \ four, which will allow for more tailored trainings to individual audiences,\
    \ e.g. line officers, managers, investigators/analysts, and trainers. The program\
    \ will work closely with federal partners to ensure a consistent message, shared\
    \ resources, and to eliminate possible duplication of activities."

- description: There has been extensive information gathering on the current state
    of domestic terrorism as well as the influence that international terrorism is
    having on domestic security. This entailed a comprehensive literature review as
    well as a series of information-gathering and collaborative meetings with others
    who work extensively in the field of counterterrorism. There has been close coordination
    with federal partners who are also working in the counterterrorism space and,
    based on all the gathered information and close coordination, SLATT has recently
    undergone extensive updating and redesign. A new, innovative, and behavior-changing
    curriculum has been developed that focuses on what each training participant needs
    to know for the role that they play within anti-terrorism prevention, identification,
    interdiction, and investigation.
