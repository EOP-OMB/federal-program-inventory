- description: 'Once DOE awards the grants, the states, tribes, and territories contract
    with roughly 700 local organizations nationwide that consists of community action
    agencies, other nonprofits, and local governments. These organizations use in-house
    crews and private contractors to perform the weatherization services for low-income
    families. Many states and local organizations leverage other federal, state and
    private WAP programs to deliver more services while inside the home.


    In 2018, the WAP Network leveraged non-DOE funds, such as from the Low Income
    Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), utilities and states funding by providing
    an additional $679 million, or $3.48 for every dollar invested by DOE (2018 National
    Association for State Community Services Programs funding survey).'
