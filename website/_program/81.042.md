    with roughly 700 local organizations nationwide that consists of community action
    agencies, other nonprofits, and local governments. These organizations use in-house
    crews and private contractors to perform the weatherization services for low-income
    families. Many states and local organizations leverage other federal, state and
    private WAP programs to deliver more services while inside the home.


    In 2018, the WAP Network leveraged non-DOE funds, such as from the Low Income
    Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), utilities and states funding by providing
    an additional $679 million, or $3.48 for every dollar invested by DOE (2018 National
    Association for State Community Services Programs funding survey).'
