- description: "For Fiscal Year 2016:\r\n(A) National Plant Diagnostic Network for\
    \ the Food and Agricultural Defense Initiative (NPDN):\r\n\r\nSix (6) applications\
    \ were received and awarded.  The NPDN awards totaled $3,032,200.\r\n\t\r\n(B)\
    \ National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) for the Food and Agricultural\
    \ Defense Initiative (aka FADI):\r\n\r\nFor FY 2016, the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Defense Initiative (FADI) will continue to support three multi-institutional\
    \ homeland security networks via non-competitively awarded cooperative agreements:\
    \ The National Plant Diagnostic Network, the National Animal Health Laboratory\
    \ Network, and the Extension Disaster Education Network.  \r\n\r\nAll three (3)\
    \ networks will continue to help prepare, prevent, detect, respond and recover\
    \ from high-consequence disease threats and other disasters.  During 2016, the\
    \ NAHLN implemented a restructure plan that employs enhanced metrics and other\
    \ semi-quantitative criteria to determine level-specific NAHLN membership eligibility.\
    \ The agency is in the process of making 16 new awards to support NAHLN labs.\
    \  \r\n\r\nWhile it appears that NIFA drastically reduced the number NAHLN Labs\
    \ supported in FY 2016, investments were the same as the previous fiscal year\
    \ (FY).  The difference is that, due to the NAHLN restructure, there was a re-assortment\
    \ of which NAHLN labs are funded by NIFA and which are funded by APHIS which collaboratively\
    \ funds NAHLN.  For FY 2016, NIFA is supporting a larger number of Level-1 labs\
    \ (largest awards size under the NAHLN tier structure), hence the smaller number\
    \ of total labs in FY 2016.\r\n\r\n(C ) Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN):\r\
    \n\r\nThis program continues to support three (3) multi-institutional homeland\
    \ security networks via non-competitively awarded cooperative agreements: The\
    \ National Plant Diagnostic Network, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network,\
    \ and the Extension Disaster Education Network. The agency is in the process of\
    \ making awards.  EDENâ€™s allocation is anticipated to be $370,800. \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n For Fiscal Year 2016:\r\n(A) National Plant Diagnostic Network for the\
    \ Food and Agricultural Defense Initiative (NPDN):\r\n\r\nSix applications were\
    \ received and awarded.  The awards totaled $3,030,660\r\n\r\n(B) National Animal\
    \ Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) for the Food and Agricultural Defense Initiative\
    \ (aka FADI):\r\n\r\nFADI: For FY 2016, the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative\
    \ (FADI) will continued to support three multi-institutional homeland security\
    \ networks via non-competitively awarded cooperative agreements: The National\
    \ Plant Diagnostic Network, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN),\
    \ and the Extension Disaster Education Network.  All three networks continued\
    \ to help prepare, prevent, detect, respond and recover from high-consequence\
    \ disease threats and other disasters.  \r\n\r\nNAHLN: During 2016, NIFA disbursed\
    \ $ 3,018,000 payment to states to the NAHLN. NAHLN implemented a restructure\
    \ plan that employs enhanced metrics and other semi-quantitative criteria to determine\
    \ level-specific NAHLN membership eligibility. The agency made 16 new awards to\
    \ support NAHLN labs.  While NIFA reduced the number NAHLN Labs it is supporting\
    \ in 2016 (compared to 2015), investments are the same as the previous year. \
    \ The difference is that, due to the NAHLN restructure, there was a reassortment\
    \ of which NAHLN labs are funded by NIFA and which are funded by APHIS which collaboratively\
    \ funds NAHLN.  APHIS has a larger percentage of the total labs in 2016. For 2016,\
    \ NIFA supported a larger number of Level-1 labs (largest award size under the\
    \ NAHLN tier structure), hence the smaller number of total labs in 2016. \r\n\r\
    \nCritical surveillance and suspect-sample testing was supported to address the\
    \ mission of safeguarding public health, enhancing the health of all animals,\
    \ and improving the economic well-being of livestock producers nationwide.  Thousands\
    \ of samples were processed testing for high-consequence livestock pathogens and\
    \ tens of thousands of samples for some of more common disease organisms.  Member\
    \ laboratories have completed or maintained proficiency certification for several\
    \ important endemic and foreign animal diseases, including: avian influenza, Newcastle\
    \ disease, Johne's disease, classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, bovine\
    \ spongiform encephalopathy, leptospirosis, bovine leukemia virus, bluetongue,\
    \ chronic wasting disease, and equine infectious anemia.\r\n\r\n(C ) Extension\
    \ Disaster Education Network (EDEN):\r\nThe Extension Disaster Education Network\
    \ project further integrated and expanded the Cooperative Extension System's educational\
    \ role before, during and after a disaster, using the all-hazards approach adopted\
    \ by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
