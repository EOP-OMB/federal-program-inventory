objective: "CDC will strengthen the U.S. public health system\u2019s response to public\
  \ health or healthcare crises by providing specialized support to State, Tribal,\
  \ Local and Territorial health departments (STLTs) when engaged in a response. Because\
  \ STLTs vary widely in capacity and expertise - as well as in the demographics and\
  \ disease burdens of the populations they serve - an emergency in any location is\
  \ likely to reveal areas in which they need assistance to launch and sustain effective\
  \ response activities.\n\nThe purpose of this program is (1) to establish a pool\
  \ of organizations capable of rapidly providing essential expertise to governmental\
  \ public health entities involved in a response, and (2) to fund select awardees\
  \ to provide that support, when required, based on CDC\u2019s determination of need.\
  \ The role of the recipient will be to function as a rapid provider of information\
  \ and/or resources, as well as a coordinator of the project management components\
  \ involved. Recipients will primarily support public health departments, but may\
  \ be engaged to support CDC programs also involved in the response."
