objective: Moving to Work (MTW) is a demonstration program for public housing authorities
  (PHAs) that provides opportunities to design and test innovative, locally designed
  strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment
  and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for low-income families.
  MTW allows PHAs exemptions from many existing public housing and voucher rules and
  provides funding flexibility with how they use their Federal funds.
