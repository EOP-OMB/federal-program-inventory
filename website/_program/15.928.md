objective: "To assist States and local communities acquire and preserve threatened\
  \ battlefield land from the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War. \n\n\
  This grant program enables the permanent protection of historic battlefield lands\
  \ through fee simple acquisition or through the purchase of an interest in the land\
  \ through a preservation covenant. State or local government entities are eligible\
  \ to apply, and nonprofit organizations often support the applicant agency in the\
  \ battlefield preservation effort. The grants require a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal\
  \ match. The ABPP administers Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants using funds appropriated\
  \ from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\nTo be eligible for acquisition,\
  \ land must be at least 50% within the boundary of one of the 384 battlefields identified\
  \ in the 1993 Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields, or one of the 677 battlefields\
  \ identified in the 2007 Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation\
  \ Study."
