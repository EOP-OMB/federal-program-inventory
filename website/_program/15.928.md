objective: "To assist States and local communities acquire and preserve threatened\
  \ battlefield land from the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War. \n\n\
  This grant program enables the permanent protection of historic battlefield lands\
  \ through fee simple acquisition or through the purchase of an interest in the land\
  \ through a preservation covenant. State or local government entities are eligible\
  \ to apply, and nonprofit organizations often support the applicant agency in the\
  \ battlefield preservation effort. The grants require a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal\
  \ match. The ABPP administers Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants using funds appropriated\
  \ from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\nTo be eligible for acquisition,\
  \ land must be at least 50% within the boundary of one of the 384 battlefields identified\
  \ in the 1993 Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields, or one of the 677 battlefields\
  \ identified in the 2007 Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation\
  \ Study."

  Act of 2009 (16 USC 469k-1), authorizes this grant program. This legislation allows
  Land and Water Conservation Fund monies to be used to provide the Federal share
  of the cost of acquiring interests in eligible Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and
  Civil War battlefield land. It requires that any interest in land acquired under
  this program shall be subject to section 6(f)(3) of the Land and Water Conservation
  Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 4601-8(f)(3)). Section 6(f)(3) requires that any land
  acquired with these funds be preserved and not converted to other uses without the
  express written consent of the Secretary of the Interior.
