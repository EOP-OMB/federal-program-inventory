objective: Through the Small Dollar Loan Program, the CDFI Fund provides (1) grants  to
  enable a certified Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) or any partnership
  between a certified CDFI and federally insured depository institution, with a primary
  mission to serve targeted Investment Areas, to establish a loan-loss reserve fund
  to cover the losses on small dollar loans from a new small dollar program or an
  existing small dollar loan program; and (2) grants for Technical Assistance to a
  certified CDFI or any partnership between or among certified CDFIs to establish
  and maintain small dollar loan programs.  Small Dollar Loan Program grants cannot
  be used to provide direct loans to consumers. This program is intended to provide
  an alternative to high-cost small dollar loans, as well as help unbanked and underbanked
  populations build credit, access affordable capital, and allow greater access into
  the mainstream financial system.
