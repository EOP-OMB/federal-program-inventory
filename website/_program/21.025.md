objective: Through the Small Dollar Loan Program, the CDFI Fund provides (1) grants
  to enable a certified Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) or any
  partnership between a certified CDFI and Federally Insured Depository Institution,
  with a primary mission to serve targeted Investment Areas, to establish a loan-loss
  reserve fund to cover the losses on small dollar loans from a new small dollar program
  or an existing small dollar loan program; and (2) grants for Technical Assistance
  to a certified CDFI or any partnership between or among certified CDFIs to establish
  and maintain small dollar loan programs.  Small Dollar Loan Program grants cannot
  be used to provide direct loans to consumers. This program is intended to provide
  an alternative to high-cost small dollar loans, as well as help unbanked and underbanked
  populations build credit, access affordable capital, and allow greater access into
  the mainstream financial system.
