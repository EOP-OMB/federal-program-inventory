objective: "The goals of this comprehensive program are to assist eligible states\
  \ and units of local government to collect, process, and increase capacity to process\
  \ DNA evidence for entry into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) to reduce DNA\
  \ processing backlogs, improve the timeliness of testing, and increase prosecution\
  \ of violent cold case crimes in which suspects have been identified through DNA\
  \ evidence.\n\nThe primary objective is to increase the number of CODIS-eligible\
  \ samples analyzed in eligible laboratories and to reduce DNA testing turnaround\
  \ times for CODIS entry. \n\nAdditional objectives aim to:\n•\tEnsure that DNA testing\
  \ and analysis of samples from crimes are carried out in a timely manner; and\n\
  •\tIncrease the capacity of state and local prosecuting agencies to address the\
  \ backlog of violent crime cases in which suspects have been identified through\
  \ DNA evidence.  \n\n\nDNA Capacity Enhancement for Backlog Reduction (CEBR) Program\n\
  PM 1: Number of DNA profile uploads into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) \
  \ \n\nPM 2: Number of cases completed since the beginning of the grant period. \
  \ \n\n\nProsecuting Cold Cases Using DNA (Cold Cases) Program\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 1: Violent cold cases investigations that resulted in an indictment or charging\
  \ decision; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Violent cold cases that resulted in\
  \ suspect identification."
