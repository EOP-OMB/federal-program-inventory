objective: "This program furthers the Department\u2019s mission by increasing the\
  \ capacity of state and local prosecution offices to address violent crime cold\
  \ cases, and providing resources toward the resolution of violent crime cold cases.\
  \ Which assists the criminal justice community to enforce the law, improve public\
  \ safety, prevent and reduce crime, and ensure the fair and impartial administration\
  \ of justice.\n\nThe objectives of this program are to: 1) support the prosecution\
  \ of violent crime cold cases, where DNA from a suspect has been identified [suspect(s)\
  \ may be known or unknown]; and 2) decrease the number of violent crime cold cases\
  \ awaiting prosecution.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Violent cold cases investigations\
  \ that resulted in an indictment or charging decision; and, \n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 2: Violent cold cases that resulted in suspect identification."
