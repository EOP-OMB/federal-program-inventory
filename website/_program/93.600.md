objective: "Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the cognitive,\
  \ physical, behavioral, and social-emotional development of children through the\
  \ provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to their\
  \ enrollees - low-income children and families, including those on federally recognized\
  \ tribal reservations and migratory farm workers.  The program is designed to involve\
  \ parents in their child\u2019s learning and development, and to help parents make\
  \ progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start\
  \ also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of\
  \ their local Head Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards\
  \ outline the requirements and expectations of programs in delivering these services.\
  \  Head Start programs are expected to collaborate with other early care and education\
  \ programs in their communities, and to work closely with local school systems to\
  \ continue the gains children achieve in Head Start.\n\nThrough Early Head Start\
  \ programming, the focus includes the development of children, and the enabling\
  \ of parents to fulfill their roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These\
  \ programs promote the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of\
  \ infants and toddlers through safe and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing\
  \ children for continued growth and development and eventual success in school and\
  \ life. To achieve their goals, programs are supported by a three-tier training\
  \ and technical assistance system (national, regional, and local) designed to complement\
  \ one another. Objectives of the training and technical assistance system includes\
  \ expanding staff qualifications and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\
  \nSince 2014 through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded\
  \ to meet the needs for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional\
  \ Early Head Start programs or through partnerships with center-based and family\
  \ child care providers who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.\
  \  \n\nThe Office of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves\
  \ the knowledge, skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs\
  \ which, in turn, improve the outcomes of children and families. The system includes\
  \ four National Centers, each with an area of focus that collaborate effectively\
  \ to support and promote consistent practices across Head Start/Early Head Start\
  \ communities.  The centers include Program Management and Fiscal Operations; Early\
  \ Childhood Development, Teaching and Learning; Parent, Family, and Community Engagement;\
  \ and Health, Behavioral Health, and Safety.  \n\nAwards are also issued to Tribal\
  \ Colleges & Universities for establishing or enhancing partnerships with Head Start\
  \ programs to effectively increase the number of qualified education staff working\
  \ in American Indian Alaska Native Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In\
  \ collaboration with the Office of Child Care and Office of Early Childhood Development,\
  \ Head Start provides funding to the National Early Care and Education Workforce\
  \ Center to support recruitment and retainment strategies across all Early Care\
  \ and Education settings.  In FY 2023, an award was made available on the National\
  \ Head Start Fellowship Program to support in the development and implementation\
  \ of long-term quality improvement initiatives in Head Start programs."
