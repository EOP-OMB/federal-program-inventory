objective: "Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the cognitive,\
  \ physical, behavioral, and social-emotional development of children through the\
  \ provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to their\
  \ enrollees - low-income children and families, including those on federally recognized\
  \ tribal reservations and migratory farm workers.  The program is designed to involve\
  \ parents in their childâ€™s learning and development, and to help parents make progress\
  \ toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start also emphasizes\
  \ the significant involvement of parents in the administration of their local Head\
  \ Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards outline the requirements\
  \ and expectations of programs in delivering these services.  Head Start programs\
  \ are expected to collaborate with other early care and education programs in their\
  \ communities, and to work closely with local school systems to continue the gains\
  \ children achieve in Head Start.\n\nThrough Early Head Start programming, the focus\
  \ includes the development of children, and the enabling of parents to fulfill their\
  \ roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These programs promote the physical,\
  \ cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe\
  \ and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth\
  \ and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals,\
  \ programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system\
  \ (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives\
  \ of the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications\
  \ and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\nSince 2014 through\
  \ Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs\
  \ for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start\
  \ programs or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers\
  \ who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  \n\nThe Office\
  \ of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge,\
  \ skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn,\
  \ improve the outcomes of children and families. The system includes four National\
  \ Centers, each with an area of focus that collaborate effectively to support and\
  \ promote consistent practices across Head Start/Early Head Start communities. \
  \ The centers include Program Management and Fiscal Operations; Early Childhood\
  \ Development, Teaching and Learning; Parent, Family, and Community Engagement;\
  \ and Health, Behavioral Health, and Safety.  \n\nAwards are also issued to Tribal\
  \ Colleges & Universities for establishing or enhancing partnerships with Head Start\
  \ programs to effectively increase the number of qualified education staff working\
  \ in American Indian Alaska Native Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In\
  \ collaboration with the Office of Child Care and Office of Early Childhood Development,\
  \ Head Start provides funding to the National Early Care and Education Workforce\
  \ Center to support recruitment and retainment strategies across all Early Care\
  \ and Education settings.  In FY 2023, an award was made available on the National\
  \ Head Start Fellowship Program to support in the development and implementation\
  \ of long-term quality improvement initiatives in Head Start programs."
