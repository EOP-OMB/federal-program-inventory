objective: The primary purpose of this program is to support projects that protect
  human health and the environment while advancing U.S. national interests through
  international environmental collaboration on environmental compliance and enforcement.
  International capacity building plays a key role in protecting human health, communities
  and the environment by providing technical cooperation to help countries improve
  environmental compliance and enforcement. The Office of Environmental Enforcement
  and Compliance (OECA) works to transfer appropriate compliance and enforcement tools
  and techniques to key countries and regions as we collaborate with partners to improve
  compliance with domestic environmental laws in those countries. In Fiscal Year 2025
  OECA will continue efforts to strengthen domestic, regional, and global networks
  on criminal and civil/administrative enforcement, build capacity in developing countries
  to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental laws, and share information
  with countries on targeting and advanced monitoring tools, environmental justice
  and enforcement, and addressing climate change. OECA plays a key role in ensuring
  trade-related activities support environmental protection, particularly related
  to effective enforcement of environmental laws. Initiatives relating to environmental
  trade and investment are carried out bilaterally, multilaterally or in connection
  with multilateral institutions such as the International Network for Environmental
  Compliance and Enforcement (INECE) and associated regional networks, including INTERPOL's
  Pollution Crimes Working Group. OECA will also provide targeted capacity building
  support under the environmental cooperation agreements developed parallel to U.S.
  free trade agreements.
