objective: "The Rural Health Care Program, one of the FCC\u2019s Universal Service\
  \ Fund programs, provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications\
  \ and broadband services necessary for the provision of health care.  The goal of\
  \ the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in\
  \ rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access\
  \ to telecommunications and broadband services.  The Rural Health Care Program is\
  \ currently made up of two programs: the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare\
  \ Connect Fund (HCF) Program.  The Telecommunications Program, established in 1997,\
  \ subsidizes the difference between urban and rural rates for telecommunications\
  \ services. Under the Telecommunications Program, eligible rural health care providers\
  \ can obtain rates on telecommunications services in rural areas that are reasonably\
  \ comparable to rates charged for similar services in corresponding urban areas.\
  \  The HCF Program, established in 2012, promotes the use of broadband services\
  \ and facilitates the formation of health care provider consortia that include both\
  \ rural and urban health care providers by providing a flat 65% discount on an array\
  \ of advanced telecommunications and information services.  These services include\
  \ internet access, dark fiber, business data, traditional digital service line (DSL),\
  \ and private carriage services.  Universal service has been defined by Congress\
  \ as \u201Can evolving level of telecommunications services . . . taking into account\
  \ advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.\u201D"
