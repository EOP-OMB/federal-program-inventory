objective: 'The Rural Health Care Program, one of the FCC’s Universal Service Fund
  programs, provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications
  and broadband services necessary for the provision of health care.  The goal of
  the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural
  communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to telecommunications
  and broadband services.  The Rural Health Care Program is currently made up of two
  programs: the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) Program.  The
  Telecommunications Program, established in 1997, subsidizes the difference between
  urban and rural rates for telecommunications services. Under the Telecommunications
  Program, eligible rural health care providers can obtain rates on telecommunications
  services in rural areas that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar
  services in corresponding urban areas.  The HCF Program, established in 2012, promotes
  the use of broadband services and facilitates the formation of health care provider
  consortia that include both rural and urban health care providers by providing a
  flat 65% discount on an array of advanced telecommunications and information services.  These
  services include internet access, dark fiber, business data, traditional digital
  service line (DSL), and private carriage services.  Universal service has been defined
  by Congress as “an evolving level of telecommunications services . . . taking into
  account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.”'
