objective: "The Competitive Research Program (CRP), part of the National Oceanic and\
  \ Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS),\
  \ supports the development of actionable information and tools that improve how\
  \ the nation protects, manages, and conserves ocean and coastal ecosystems. NCCOS/CRP\
  \ funds regional-scale and targeted research through a competitive, peer-reviewed\
  \ process to address our Nation\u2019s most pressing issues including harmful algal\
  \ blooms and hypoxia research as authorized under the\nHarmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia\
  \ Research and Control Act, coastal resiliency, sea-level rise, ocean acidification,\
  \ mesophotic coral ecosystems, and effective ecosystem-based management."

results:
- description: CRP continues to support its harmful algal bloom (HAB) and hypoxia
    research with monitoring and modeling capabilities to provide managers with seasonal
    HAB and hypoxia forecasts in numerous regions in the US including the Gulf of
    Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie, Gulf of Maine, and coastal Washington, Oregon,
    and California. CRP also continues to support effects of seal level rise (ESLR)
    to enhance Natural and Nature-based Features (NNBF) for coastal resilience in
    the Gulf of Mexico, the Mid- and SE coastal Atlantic and the Pacific Coast. Regarding
    corals, CRP continues regional ecosystem and mesophotic coral ecosystem connectivity
    studies in the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and American Samoa. New CRP research in
    FY22 is investigating the relationship between ocean acidification and HABs, providing
    support for a control incubator for HABs and a project examining the effects of
    multiple stressors on organisms in the Northern California Current and support
    for multiple ESLR projects to understand the ecological effects of sea level rise
    on the West and East coast.

    FY23 will fund targeted Prevention Control and Mitigation of Harmful Algal Bloom
    (PCMHAB) proposals that advance new methods for HAB toxin measurement in seafood
    to prevent human illnesses, and Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal
    Blooms (MERHAB) targeted and regional proposals that build and sustain capacity
    for monitoring and observing of HABs and associated toxins; Coastal Hypoxia Research
    Program (CHRP) projects to improve the understanding of physical/biogeochemical
    effects of hypoxia and potential synergies with other stressors on living resources,
    habitats, and food webs and projects from the Effects of Sea Level Rise (ESLR)
    Technical Assistance program that will lead to the application of mature modeling
    approaches developed under existing research projects that apply existing advanced
    modeling approaches to evaluate land management actions, flood mitigation designs,
    and policy scenarios under climate scenarios to inform future restoration and
    flood mitigation project applications.
