objective: 'The Competitive Research Program (CRP), part of the National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS),
  supports the development of actionable information and tools that improve how the
  nation protects, manages, and conserves ocean and coastal ecosystems. NCCOS/CRP
  funds regional-scale and targeted research through a competitive, peer-reviewed
  process to address our Nation’s most pressing issues including harmful algal blooms
  and hypoxia research as authorized under the

  Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, coastal resiliency, sea-level
  rise, ocean acidification, mesophotic coral ecosystems, and effective ecosystem-based
  management.'

- description: CSCOR continued to support it's harmful algal bloom (HAB) and hypoxia
    research with monitoring and modeling capabilities to provide managers with seasonal
    HAB and hypoxia forecasts in numerous regions in the US including the Gulf of
    Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie, Gulf of Maine, and coastal Washington, Oregon,
    and California. New studies are supporting the ecological effects of sea level
    rise on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, San Francisco Bay, and unique Hawaiian
    Island inland ponds connected to the ocean. New support is provided for the combined
    effects of ocean acidification and hypoxia on living marine resources around the
    U.S. Socioeconomic studies are focusing on valuing ecosystem services
  year: '2016'
- description: CSCOR initiated new research projects in its harmful algal bloom research
    programs, as well as continue existing projects in its ecosystem stressors and
    regional research programs in coastal regions such as the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic,
    Gulf of Maine and Gulf of Mexico
  year: '2017'
- description: Pending appropriations, CSCOR expects to initiate new research project
    in its Regional Ecosystem Prediction Program, Hypoxia and Ocean Acidification
    programs, as well as continuing existing projects in its ecosystem stressors and
    regional research programs in coastal regions such as the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic,
    Gulf of Maine and Gulf of Mexico
  year: '2018'
- description: CRP continued to support its harmful algal bloom (HAB) and hypoxia
    research with monitoring and modeling capabilities to provide managers with seasonal
    HAB and hypoxia forecasts in numerous regions in the US including the Gulf of
    Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie, Gulf of Maine, and coastal Washington, Oregon,
    and California. Research investigated HAB socioeconomics and HAB prevention, control
    and mitigation. Studies continued supporting the effects of sea level rise (ESLR)
    on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and the use of natural and nature-based features
    (NNBF) to mitigate sea level rise around the U.S.  Coral ecosystem research continued
    on connectivity of coral ecosystems in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico and the
    mesophotic coral ecosystems of American Samoa. Support continued for the combined
    effects of ocean acidification (OA) and hypoxia on living marine resources.
  year: '2020'
- description: 'CRP continues to support its harmful algal bloom (HAB) and hypoxia
    research with monitoring and modeling capabilities to provide managers with seasonal
    HAB and hypoxia forecasts in numerous regions in the US including the Gulf of
    Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie, Gulf of Maine, and coastal Washington, Oregon,
    and California. CRP also continues to support effects of seal level rise (ESLR)
    to enhance Natural and Nature-based Features (NNBF) for coastal resilience in
    the Gulf of Mexico, the Mid- and SE coastal Atlantic and the Pacific Coast. Regarding
    corals, CRP continues regional ecosystem and mesophotic coral ecosystem connectivity
    studies in the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and American Samoa. Support continues for
    the combined effects of ocean acidification (OA) and hypoxia on living marine
    resources.


    New CRP research in FY21 investigates coastal and surface transportation resilience
    for management applications along the coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, eastern
    U.S. seaboard, and New England. New regional ecosystem research investigates species’
    habitat requirements and ecosystem connectivity among and within Marine Protected
    Areas (MPAs). New HAB research supports application of clay flocculation for removal
    of Karenia brevis cells, enhancing the capabilities of the 3rd Generation Environmental
    Sample Processor (3G ESP) for HAB toxin detection, and developing an optimized
    early warning program for the mitigation of HAB Impacts on shellfish in the Pacific
    Northwest.


    Future support is being planned for investigating the relationship between ocean
    acidification and HABs.'

    studies in the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and American Samoa. New CRP research in
    FY22 is investigating the relationship between ocean acidification and HABs, providing
    support for a control incubator for HABs and a project examining the effects of
    multiple stressors on organisms in the Northern California Current and support
    for multiple ESLR projects to understand the ecological effects of sea level rise
    on the West and East coast.

    (PCMHAB) proposals that advance new methods for HAB toxin measurement in seafood
    to prevent human illnesses, and Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal
    Blooms (MERHAB) targeted and regional proposals that build and sustain capacity
    for monitoring and observing of HABs and associated toxins; Coastal Hypoxia Research
    Program (CHRP) projects to improve the understanding of physical/biogeochemical
    effects of hypoxia and potential synergies with other stressors on living resources,
    habitats, and food webs and projects from the Effects of Sea Level Rise (ESLR)
    Technical Assistance program that will lead to the application of mature modeling
    approaches developed under existing research projects that apply existing advanced
    modeling approaches to evaluate land management actions, flood mitigation designs,
    and policy scenarios under climate scenarios to inform future restoration and
    flood mitigation project applications.
