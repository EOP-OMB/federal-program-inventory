objective: 'To foster understanding of human health effects of exposure to environmental
  agents in the hope that these studies will lead to: the identification of agents
  that pose a hazard and threat of disease, disorders and defects in humans; the development
  of effective public health or disease prevention strategies; the overall improvement
  of human health effects due to environmental agents; the development of products
  and technologies designed to better study or ameliorate the effects of environmental
  agents; and the successful training of research scientists in all areas of environmental
  health research. Supported grant programs focus on the following areas: (1) Understanding
  biological responses to environmental agents by determining how chemical and physical
  agents cause pathological changes in molecules, cells, tissues, and organs, and
  become manifested as respiratory disease, neurological, behavioral and developmental
  abnormalities, cancer, and other disorders; (2) Determining the mechanisms of toxicity
  of ubiquitous agents like metals, natural and synthetic chemicals, pesticides, and
  materials such as nanoparticles, and natural toxic substances, and their effects
  of on various human organ systems, on metabolism, on the endocrine and immune systems,
  and on other biological functions; (3) Developing and integrating scientific knowledge
  about potentially toxic and hazardous chemicals by concentrating on toxicological
  research, testing, test development, validation and risk estimation; (4) Identifying
  interactions between environmental stressors and genetic susceptibility and understanding
  biologic mechanisms underlying these interactions, including the study of environmental
  influences on epigenomics and transcriptional regulation; (5) Conducting environmental
  public health research, including in areas of environmental justice and health disparities,
  that requires communities as active participants in all stages of research, dissemination,
  and evaluation to advance both the science and the development of practical materials
  for use in communities, with a focus on translating research findings into tools,
  materials, and resources that can be used to prevent, reduce, or eliminate adverse
  health outcomes caused by environmental exposures; (6) Expanding and improving the
  SBIR program; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived
  from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation; (7) Expanding and improving
  the STTR program to stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation
  through cooperative research and development carried out between small business
  concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation; (8)
  Providing support for broadly based multi-disciplinary research and training programs
  in environmental health .These programs include the Environmental Health Sciences
  Core Centers , which serve as national focal points and resources for research and
  manpower development. Through these programs, NIEHS expects to achieve the long-range
  goal of developing new clinical and public health applications to improve disease
  prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Additional Centers programs developed in recent
  years, include the Centers for Oceans and Human Health (co-funded with NSF), Children''s
  Environmental Health Centers (co-funded with US EPA) and the Autism Centers of Excellence
  (co-funded with other NIH Institutes), and the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource
  (HHEAR) program; (9) Supporting research training programs which serve to increase
  the pool of trained research manpower with needed expertise in the Environmental
  Health Sciences through support of Individual and Institutional National Research
  Service Awards (NRSAs); (10) The Outstanding New Environmental Scientist Program
  which provides first time research grant funding to outstanding junior scientists
  in the formative stages of their career who are proposing to make a long term commitment
  to environmental health sciences research and to address the adverse effects on
  environmental exposures on human biology, human pathophysiology and human disease.'
