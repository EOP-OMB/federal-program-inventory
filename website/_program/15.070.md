objective: The ESP program provides funding that allows agencies to enter into agreements
  with non-profit organizations to provide opportunities to qualified individuals
  55 years of age and older who have specific technical skills and abilities not available
  or underrepresented at current staffing levels.  Qualified individuals who are part
  of the ESP will support Reclamation in managing, developing, and protecting water
  and related resources.  ESP participants will provide technical assistance and support
  to Reclamation in developing and executing projects in an environmentally and economically
  sound manner in the interest of the American public.  The ESP participants will
  not replace or displace current Reclamation employees.
