  of students enrolled in MSIs across the nation in STEM disciplines. Workforce Development:
  providing individuals the opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills and training

  the STEM capabilities of MSIs by collaborating with the Department’s national laboratories
  and scientific facilities. Technical Assistance: to enhance competitiveness through
  sharing information and expertise, instruction, skills, and working knowledge relative
  to particular needs and priorities. Training: certification, apprenticeship, placement
  preparation, and partnerships with community colleges to develop and deliver targeted
  training for regional energy sector employment opportunities. Workforce/Pipeline
