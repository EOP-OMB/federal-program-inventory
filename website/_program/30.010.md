objective: The Equal Pay Act (EPA) prohibits an employer from paying unequal compensation
  (including but not limited to pay) to men and women who perform jobs that require
  substantially equal skill, effort and responsibility, under similar working conditions
  within the same establishment.  The EPA also prohibits retaliation against applicants
  or employees who oppose compensation practices that discriminate based on sex or
  who file a discrimination charge, testify, or participate in any way in an investigation,
  proceeding, or litigation under the EPA.
