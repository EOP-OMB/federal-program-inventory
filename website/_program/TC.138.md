objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. Under current law, however, taxpayers with children
  under age 18 can qualify for a child tax credit. In taxable years 2022 through 2025,
  taxpayers may claim a $2,000 per child partially refundable child tax credit. In
  2024 up to $1,700 per child of unclaimed credit due to insufficient tax liability
  may be refundableâ€”taxpayers may claim a refund for 15 percent of earnings in excess
  of a $2,500 floor, up to the lesser of the amount of unused credit or $1,700 per
  child. A taxpayer may also claim a nonrefundable credit of $500 for each qualifying
  child not eligible for the $2,000 credit (those over sixteen and those without SSNs)
  and for each dependent relative. The total combined child and other dependent credit
  is phased out for taxpayers at the rate of $50 per $1,000 of modified AGI above
  $400,000 if married filing jointly ($200,000 for all other filers). For tax years
  beginning after December 31, 2025, the credit returns to its pre-TCJA value of $1,000.
  At that time, up to the full value of the credit (subject to a phase-in of 15 percent
  of earnings in excess of $3,000) will be refundable and the $500 other dependent
  credit will expire. The credit will once again phase out at the rate of $50 per
  $1,000 of modified AGI above $110,000 if married filing jointly ($75,000 for single
  or head of household filers and $55,000 for married taxpayers filing separately).
