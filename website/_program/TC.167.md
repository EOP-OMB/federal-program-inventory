objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent
  accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. In contrast,
  all compensation due to death or disability paid by the Veterans Administration
  is excluded from taxable income under current law.
