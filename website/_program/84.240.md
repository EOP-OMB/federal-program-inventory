objective: To provide grants for States, and to the eligible system serving the American
  Indian Consortium when sufficient funds are appropriated for the program in accordance
  with section 509(c)(1)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act),
  to support protection and advocacy systems to protect the legal and human rights
  of individuals with disabilities who are ineligible for services from the other
  protection and advocacy programs or whose problems fall outside the scope of services
  available from the Client Assistance Program (CAP). This program is subject to a
  statutory non-supplanting requirement and, therefore, must use a restricted indirect
  cost rate in accordance with 34 CFR 76.563 through 76.569. For assistance with questions
  related to the restricted indirect cost rate, email the Indirect Cost Division at
  IndirectCostDivision@ed.gov.
