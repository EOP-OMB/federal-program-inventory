objective: "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and\
  \ energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states and the\
  \ American Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of\
  \ oil, natural gas, and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the\
  \ Nation\u2019s outer continental shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways\
  \ to serve the American people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best value\
  \ for its resources now and into the future. The program not only supports decisions\
  \ made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal States and\
  \ local governments with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of\
  \ offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner to protect both\
  \ the human and natural environments. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)\
  \ Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected States\
  \ to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information, joint utilization\
  \ of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out\
  \ applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer\
  \ continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore. The BOEM Resource Evaluation\
  \ Division maintains an interest in understanding the distribution and characterization\
  \ of gas hydrate on the OCS, particularly as it relates to an assessment of gas\
  \ hydrate accumulations as a potential energy resource."
