objective: MPP-Dairy offers a protection plan which provides payments to dairy operations
  when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed cost falls below
  a certain, producer selected, dollar amount.  Producers will be eligible for a basic
  level of margin protection for a small administrative fee, and be able to purchase
  greater coverage for a premium.  The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) will use
  administrative fees collected to cover administrative costs incurred to carry out
  the margin protection program.  Not renewed with Agriculture Improvement Act of
  2018, see Dairy Margin Coverage, CFDA 10.127.
