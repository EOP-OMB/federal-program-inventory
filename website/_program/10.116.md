  when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed cost falls below
  a certain, producer selected, dollar amount.  Producers will be eligible for a basic
  level of margin protection for a small administrative fee, and be able to purchase
  greater coverage for a premium.  The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) will use
  administrative fees collected to cover administrative costs incurred to carry out
  the margin protection program.  Not renewed with Agriculture Improvement Act of
