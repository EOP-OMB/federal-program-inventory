objective: Public Programs grants provide opportunities for the American public to
  explore human history and culture through humanities programs in museums, historical
  organizations, libraries, community centers, and other gathering places, as well
  as on public television, radio, the Internet, and other digital media. The Public
  Humanities Projects program supports projects that bring the ideas of the humanities
  to life for general audiences. The Media Projects program supports the development,
  production, and distribution of radio programs, podcasts, documentary films, and
  documentary film. The Digital Projects for the Public program supports projects
  that interpret and analyze humanities content in primarily digital platforms and
  formats. Public Impact Projects helps small and mid-sized cultural organizations
  expand their public programs.
