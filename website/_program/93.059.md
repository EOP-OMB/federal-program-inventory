results:
- description: 'In AY 2021-2022, the most recent year for which performance data is
    available, the Postdoctoral Dental Program trained 711 dental residents and fellows.
    A total of 575 residents and fellows completed their Postdoctoral training programs
    during AY 2021-2022. Of the 109 graduates who reported employment data at the
    end of the academic year, 79 percent were already working in primary care settings
    and 35 percent were already working in medically underserved 125 communities.
    Of the 104 prior year graduates with one-year follow-up data, 41 percent currently
    work in primary care settings and 26 percent currently  5work in medically underserved
    communities and/or rural areas. Through the Postdoctoral Program, dental residents
    and fellows accumulated over one million patient encounters in primary care dental
    settings and almost 900,000 patient encounters in medically underserved communities.


    In AY 2021-2022, the most recent year for which performance data is available,
    the DFLRP provided loan repayment to 100 dental faculty. The program relieved
    over $2.1 million in debt, which was approximately 15 percent of the student loan
    debt reported by participating faculty. Thirty-nine percent of the faculty were
    underrepresented minorities, 29 percent were from disadvantaged backgrounds, and
    15 percent were from rural backgrounds. Awardees also sponsored 50 faculty development
    programs for 170 dental faculty. Since receiving their DFLRP funding, awardees
    have recruited and retained 55 faculty.'
