objective: The MSE Program provides grants to public institutions of higher education
  to expand or support graduate education for medical students preparing to become
  physicians in the top quintile of states with a projected primary care provider
  shortage in 2036. The program is designed to prepare and encourage medical students
  training in the most underserved states to choose residencies and careers in primary
  care that serve tribal communities, rural communities, and/or medically underserved
  communities (MUCs) after they graduate. This will be accomplished by supporting
  the development of medical school curricula, clinical training site partnerships,
  and faculty training programs, with the goal of educating medical students who are
  likely to choose career paths in primary care, especially for tribal communities,
  rural communities, and/or MUCs.

- description: The Medical Student Education (MSE) program cohort 1 of 5 medical schools
    began in 2019, and cohort 2 of 5 additional medical schools began in 2020. In
    Academic Year 2019-2020, the Medical Student Education (MSE) program had 551 trainees.
    Approximately 22.7% of MSE trainees reported coming from financially and/or educationally
    disadvantaged backgrounds, and 16% were underrepresented minorities.  Faculty
    developed or enhanced 32 courses and trained 1,146 individuals.

- description: 'The Medical Student Education (MSE) program cohort 1 of 5 medical
    schools began in 2019, and cohort 2 of 5 additional medical schools began in 2020.
    In FY 2021, HRSA awarded supplements totaling nearly $50 million to each of the
    10 MSE grantees, including the five awards from the FY 2019 cohort and the five
    awards from the FY 2020 cohort. These supplemental awards enabled HRSA to provide
    all 10 of the MSE grantees with the same level of award amount over the performance
    period of their respective grants. In Academic Year 2020-2021, MSE awardees trained
    1,089 medical students. Thirty-eight percent of these students were from rural
    or disadvantaged backgrounds. MSE awardees developed or enhanced 96 medical school
    courses and trainings focused on the skills medical students need to practice
    primary care in rural, tribal, and other underserved communities. In addition,
    MSE awardees enhanced community-based partnerships with 246 sites to offer experiential
    training opportunities in primary care settings (97 percent), MUCs (56 percent),
    and rural areas (45 percent).


    Awardees used telehealth modalities and telemedicine networks to connect clinicians
    to rural patients and provide care and education through telemedicine. Fifty-six
    percent of MSE trainees received training in telehealth and 53 percent of sites
    offered telehealth services. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 28 percent
    of medical students received COVID-19 related training and 38 percent of experiential
    training sites offered COVID-19 related services. Students also received training
    in integrated behavioral health in primary care (58 percent), opioid use treatment
    (51 percent), and health equity/the social determinants of health (28 percent).
    There were 26 graduates (completing medical school typically requires four years,
    and this was only the second year of the program), all of whom matched to a medical
    residency program. Twelve matched to Family Medicine residencies, six to Internal
    Medicine residencies, three to Emergency Medicine residencies, three to Internal
    Medicine/Pediatrics or General Pediatrics and two to other medical residency programs'

    \ minorities and/or from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds and 32 percent were from\
    \ rural backgrounds. MSE trained 81 students who self-identified solely as American\
    \ Indian or Alaskan Natives (AI/AN). This represented 47 percent of U.S. Doctor\

    \ the U.S. from AY 2021-2022. A total of 354 medical students matched to residency\
    \ programs, including 177 graduates who matched to primary care residency programs.\
    \ Primary care specialties included family medicine (23 percent), internal medicine\
    \ (15 percent), and pediatrics (12 percent). The 177 non-primary care graduates\
    \ matched to general or specialty surgery (14 percent), emergency medicine (six\
    \ percent), psychiatry (five percent), obstetrics and gynecology (three percent),\
    \ and other specialties (22 percent). Of the 25 graduates from the prior academic\
    \ year with one-year follow-up data, 24 percent are enrolled in residency programs\
    \ located in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas. MSE awardees\
    \ collaborated with 383 health care delivery sites to provide 4,875 clinical training\
    \ experiences. Sixty-eight percent of these sites were in medically underserved\
    \ communities and/or rural settings; 56 percent offered interprofessional, team-based\
    \ training that involved 1,615 other trainees. Collectively, MSE students accumulated\
    \ over 150,000 contact hours in primary care settings, over 120,000 contact hours\
    \ in medically underserved communities, and over 70,000 contact hours in rural\
