objective: "The MSE Program provides grants to public institutions of higher education\
  \ to expand or support graduate education for medical students preparing to become\
  \ physicians in the top quintile of states with a projected primary care provider\
  \ shortage in 2025 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources\
  \ and Services Administration. HRSA, 2015. \u201CState-Level Projections of Supply\
  \ and Demand for Primary Care Practitioners: 2013-2025.\u201D November 2016). The\
  \ program is designed to prepare and encourage medical students training in the\
  \ most underserved states to choose residencies and careers in primary care that\
  \ serve tribal communities, rural communities, and/or medically underserved communities\
  \ (MUCs) after they graduate. This will be accomplished by supporting the development\
  \ of medical school curricula, clinical training site partnerships, and faculty\
  \ training programs, with the goal of educating medical students who are likely\
  \ to choose career paths in primary care, especially for tribal communities, rural\
  \ communities, and/or MUCs."
