objective: "The MSE Program provides grants to public institutions of higher education\
  \ to expand or support graduate education for medical students preparing to become\
  \ physicians in the top quintile of states with a projected primary care provider\
  \ shortage in 2025 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources\
  \ and Services Administration. HRSA, 2015. \u201CState-Level Projections of Supply\
  \ and Demand for Primary Care Practitioners: 2013-2025.\u201D November 2016). The\
  \ program is designed to prepare and encourage medical students training in the\
  \ most underserved states to choose residencies and careers in primary care that\
  \ serve tribal communities, rural communities, and/or medically underserved communities\
  \ (MUCs) after they graduate. This will be accomplished by supporting the development\
  \ of medical school curricula, clinical training site partnerships, and faculty\
  \ training programs, with the goal of educating medical students who are likely\
  \ to choose career paths in primary care, especially for tribal communities, rural\
  \ communities, and/or MUCs."

- description: "Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022, the most recent year for which performance\
    \ data is available, the MSE Program trained 2,553 medical students in medically\
    \ underserved states. Thirty-seven percent of MSE students were underrepresented\
    \ minorities and/or from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds and 32 percent were from\
    \ rural backgrounds. MSE trained 81 students who self-identified solely as American\
    \ Indian or Alaskan Natives (AI/AN). This represented 47 percent of U.S. Doctor\
    \ of Medicine (MD) program enrollees from AI/AN-only backgrounds and 28 percent\
    \ of AI/AN-only matriculants/first-year students. By the end of the academic year,\
    \ 372 trainees graduated from medical school. The MSE Program\u2019s 23 AI/AN-only\
    \ graduates accounted for 88 percent of all AI/AN-only MD program graduates in\
    \ the U.S. from AY 2021-2022. A total of 354 medical students matched to residency\
    \ programs, including 177 graduates who matched to primary care residency programs.\
    \ Primary care specialties included family medicine (23 percent), internal medicine\
    \ (15 percent), and pediatrics (12 percent). The 177 non-primary care graduates\
    \ matched to general or specialty surgery (14 percent), emergency medicine (six\
    \ percent), psychiatry (five percent), obstetrics and gynecology (three percent),\
    \ and other specialties (22 percent). Of the 25 graduates from the prior academic\
    \ year with one-year follow-up data, 24 percent are enrolled in residency programs\
    \ located in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas. MSE awardees\
    \ collaborated with 383 health care delivery sites to provide 4,875 clinical training\
    \ experiences. Sixty-eight percent of these sites were in medically underserved\
    \ communities and/or rural settings; 56 percent offered interprofessional, team-based\
    \ training that involved 1,615 other trainees. Collectively, MSE students accumulated\
    \ over 150,000 contact hours in primary care settings, over 120,000 contact hours\
    \ in medically underserved communities, and over 70,000 contact hours in rural\
    \ areas."
