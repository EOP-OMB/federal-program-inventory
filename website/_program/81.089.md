objective: "The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management\u2019s mission is to\
  \ minimize the environmental impacts of fossil fuels while working towards net-zero\
  \ emissions. The Office\u2019s programs use research, development, demonstration,\
  \ and deployment approaches to advance technologies to reduce carbon emissions and\
  \ other environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and use, particularly in\
  \ the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors of electricity and industrial. Priority areas\
  \ of technology work include point-source carbon capture, hydrogen with carbon management,\
  \ methane emissions reduction, critical mineral production, and atmospheric carbon\
  \ dioxide removal. The Office works to leverage international expertise to advance\
  \ global decarbonization, is committed to improving the conditions of communities\
  \ impacted by the legacy of fossil fuel use, and supports a healthy economic transition\
  \ that accelerates the growth of good-paying jobs."
