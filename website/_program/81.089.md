objective: The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management’s mission is to minimize
  the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuel and industrial processes while
  working to achieve net-zero emissions across the U.S. economy. The Office’s programs
  use research, development, demonstration, and deployment approaches to advance technologies
  to reduce carbon emissions and other environmental impacts of fossil fuel production
  and use, particularly in the hardest-to-decarbonize applications in the electricity
  and industrial sector. Priority areas of technology work include point-source carbon
  capture, hydrogen with carbon management, methane emissions reduction, critical
  mineral production, and atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. The Office works to
  leverage international expertise to advance global decarbonization and is committed
  to improving the conditions of communities impacted by the legacy of fossil fuel
  use while supporting a healthy economic transition that accelerates the growth of
  good-paying jobs. Finally, the Office supports novel, early-stage research at U.S.
  colleges and universities.
