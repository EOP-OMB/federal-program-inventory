objective: The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management’s mission is to minimize
  the environmental impacts of fossil fuels while working towards net-zero emissions.
  The Office’s programs use research, development, demonstration, and deployment approaches
  to advance technologies to reduce carbon emissions and other environmental impacts
  of fossil fuel production and use, particularly in the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors
  of electricity and industrial. Priority areas of technology work include point-source
  carbon capture, hydrogen with carbon management, methane emissions reduction, critical
  mineral production, and atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. The Office works to
  leverage international expertise to advance global decarbonization, is committed
  to improving the conditions of communities impacted by the legacy of fossil fuel
  use, and supports a healthy economic transition that accelerates the growth of good-paying
  jobs.
