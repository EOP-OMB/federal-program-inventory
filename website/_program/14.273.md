  \ and Urban Development's (HUD's) PFS Demonstration is to strengthen communities\u2019\
  \ ability to prevent and end homelessness and reduce avoidable incarceration by\
  \ increasing the provision of Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), a proven evidenced-based\
  \ practice. The PFS Demonstration is an opportunity to equip communities with a\
  \ new financing mechanism for funding PSH projects that will prevent returns to\
  \ homelessness and reduce recidivism among the reentry population. The PFS Demonstration\
  \ is also a valuable opportunity to test ways of achieving greater cost efficiency\
  \ and effectiveness in providing homelessness assistance while expanding communities\u2019\
  \ access to available funding for PSH."
