objective: In April of 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act
  of 2014 (PAMA), which authorized a four year pilot program to award grants for Assisted
  Outpatient Treatment (AOT) programs for individuals with serious mental illness.  The
  goal of the pilot program is to improve the health and social outcomes for the individuals
  served in the program such as increasing healthcare utilization, improving behavioral
  health and other health outcomes, and reducing rates of homelessness and incarceration.  The
  AOT program will prepare and execute evidence-based, recovery oriented, and person-centered
  treatment plans with consumer input, provide case management and evidence-based
  serves that support he individual and the treatment plan, ensure individuals are
  made aware of criteria for AOT completion, and ensure appropriate referrals to medical
  and social services providers based on the individualâ€™s needs.
