objective: "In April of 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act\
  \ of 2014 (PAMA), which authorized a four year pilot program to award grants for\
  \ Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) programs for individuals with serious mental\
  \ illness.  The goal of the pilot program is to improve the health and social outcomes\
  \ for the individuals served in the program such as increasing healthcare utilization,\
  \ improving behavioral health and other health outcomes, and reducing rates of homelessness\
  \ and incarceration.  The AOT program will prepare and execute evidence-based, recovery\
  \ oriented, and person-centered treatment plans with consumer input, provide case\
  \ management and evidence-based serves that support he individual and the treatment\
  \ plan, ensure individuals are made aware of criteria for AOT completion, and ensure\
  \ appropriate referrals to medical and social services providers based on the individual\u2019\
  s needs."
