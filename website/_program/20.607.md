objective: To encourage States to enact and enforce a compliant alcohol open container
  law. Under Section 154, to avoid the transfer of funds, a State must enact and enforce
  an open container law that prohibits the possession of any open alcoholic beverage
  container, or the consumption of any alcoholic beverage, in the passenger area of
  any motor vehicle (including possession or consumption by the driver of the vehicle)
  located on a public highway, or the right-of-way of a public highway, in the State.
