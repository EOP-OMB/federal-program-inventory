objective: "EDA’s Office of Innovation & Entrepreneurship is committed to furthering\
  \ technology-based economic development initiatives that accelerate high-quality\
  \ job growth, create more economic opportunities, and support the future of the\
  \ next generation of industry-leading companies. To advance these goals, EDA awards\
  \ grants through the Build to Scale Program to develop and support regional innovation\
  \ initiatives that help to build regional economies through scalable, technology-driven\
  \ startups as described in the EDA administered portions of Stevenson-Wydler Technology\
  \ Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. § 3720 3723) (Stevenson-Wydler).\nAs these regional\
  \ innovation initiatives scale across the country, America has benefited from growth\
  \ in jobs requiring sophisticated science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)\
  \ skills. High-skilled human capital is proving essential to the growth and expansion\
  \ of these regional technological ecosystems; however, U.S. employers have struggled\
  \ to fill jobs in these fields, and younger or leaner firms, like many innovative\
  \ startups, are especially hard hit by this challenge. An increasing number of jobs\
  \ that require STEM skills do not require a bachelor’s degree, and other education\
  \ and training pathways – such as apprenticeships, fellowships, and other work-based\
  \ learning models  – are becoming instrumental in meeting the urgent demand for\
  \ a STEM-capable workforce.  \nTo meet these demands, Section 28 of Stevenson-Wydler\
  \ (15 U.S.C. § 3723), authorizes EDA to carry out a grant program to identify and\
  \ develop strategies that support the growth of STEM talent development programs,\
  \ and to implement those programs where plans and strategies exist."
