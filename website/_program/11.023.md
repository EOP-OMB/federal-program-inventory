objective: "EDA\u2019s Office of Innovation & Entrepreneurship is committed to furthering\
  \ technology-based economic development initiatives that accelerate high-quality\
  \ job growth, create more economic opportunities, and support the future of the\
  \ next generation of industry-leading companies. To advance these goals, EDA awards\
  \ grants through the Build to Scale Program to develop and support regional innovation\
  \ initiatives that help to build regional economies through scalable, technology-driven\
  \ startups as described in the EDA administered portions of Stevenson-Wydler Technology\
  \ Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. \xA7 3720 3723) (Stevenson-Wydler).\nAs these\
  \ regional innovation initiatives scale across the country, America has benefited\
  \ from growth in jobs requiring sophisticated science, technology, engineering,\
  \ and math (STEM) skills. High-skilled human capital is proving essential to the\
  \ growth and expansion of these regional technological ecosystems; however, U.S.\
  \ employers have struggled to fill jobs in these fields, and younger or leaner firms,\
  \ like many innovative startups, are especially hard hit by this challenge. An increasing\
  \ number of jobs that require STEM skills do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree,\
  \ and other education and training pathways \u2013 such as apprenticeships, fellowships,\
  \ and other work-based learning models  \u2013 are becoming instrumental in meeting\
  \ the urgent demand for a STEM-capable workforce.  \nTo meet these demands, Section\
  \ 28 of Stevenson-Wydler (15 U.S.C. \xA7 3723), authorizes EDA to carry out a grant\
  \ program to identify and develop strategies that support the growth of STEM talent\
  \ development programs, and to implement those programs where plans and strategies\
  \ exist."
