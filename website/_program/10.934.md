- description: There are two rounds of pilot projects in this program. Round 1 consists
    of 20 projects and Round 2 has 14 projects, totaling 34 projects across 12 states.
    These 34 projects were selected for funding and are supported by 22 grants with
    the selected partners. As of June 18, 2021, the Round 1 projects have assisted
    over 750 landowners on almost 1.3 million acres in the removal of feral swine.
    Each project is participating in the National Landowner Damage Assessment Survey
    which aims to provide better estimates and tracking of the damage caused by feral
    swine in the project areas. Examples of project activities accomplished in the
    first year include creating websites for reporting feral swine sightings and damages,
    trapping demonstrations, water quality monitoring, and removing feral swine.
