objective: 'To improve screening and early detection strategies and to develop accurate
  diagnostic techniques and methods for predicting the course of disease in cancer
  patients. Screening and Early Detection research includes development of strategies
  to decrease cancer mortality by finding tumors early when they are more amenable
  to treatment. Diagnosis research focuses on methods to determine the presence of
  a specific type of cancer; to predict its course and response to therapy, both a
  particular therapy or a class of agents; and to monitor the effect of the therapy
  and the appearance of disease recurrence. These methods include diagnostic imaging
  and direct analyses of specimens from tumor or other tissues. Support is also provided
  for establishing and maintaining resources of human tissue to facilitate research.  Small
  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program: To expand and improve the SBIR program;
  to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal
  research and development; to increase small business participation in Federal research
  and development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and economically
  disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in
  technological innovation. Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program: To
  stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation through cooperative
  research and development carried out between small business concerns and research
  institutions; to foster technology transfer between small business concerns and
  research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation
  of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation.'
