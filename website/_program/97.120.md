objective: "The 97.120 CFDA was used in FY 2016 for the newly authorized Rural Emergency\
  \ Medical Communications Demonstration Project (REMCDP) and again in FY 2018, 2020,\
  \ 2022, and 2023 to reestablish the grant.  The grant opportunity leverages emergency\
  \ communications infrastructure, improves operational effectiveness, addresses National\
  \ Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) implementation gaps, and provides communications\
  \ training and education to enable improved rural medical services.  \n\nThe Presidential\
  \ Policy Directive\u20138 emphasizes national preparedness as a shared responsibility\
  \ of the whole community, requiring greater involvement across multiple jurisdictions\
  \ and disciplines.  REMCDP aids in meeting that goal by working with up to two public\
  \ and state-controlled institutions of higher education, states, U.S. territories,\
  \ local governments (e.g. county, city, or township), or Federally-recognized Tribal\
  \ governments in collaboration with a medical facility to examine communications\
  \ barriers and identify solutions that enhance existing emergency communications\
  \ infrastructure to improve the delivery of rural medical care and address NECP\
  \ implementation gaps."

    \ (CISA) published the FY 2022 REMCDP Notice of Funding Opportunity on June 1,\
    \ 2022. The extended application period closed on July 29, 2022, and CISA completed\
    \ a merit-based review process and awarded $1,892,500 in September 2022 to the\
    \ University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC). UMMC submits quarterly financial\
    \ and performance reports and communicates regularly with CISA. In addition, CISA\
    \ conducted a site visit at UMMC facilities in Jackson, MS, on December 2, 2022,\
    \ including discussion of programmatic monitoring, inventory of equipment purchased\
    \ with REMDCP funds (e.g., radio cache, radio asset distribution vehicles, training\
    \ supplies, audio/visual production, bleeding control kits), and review of FY\
    \ 2022 award plans and panel feedback. As a continuation from previous awards,\
    \ UMMC offered the online First Voice course and conducted in-person First Hands\
    \ courses for first responders across Mississippi. UMMC completed updates to the\
    \ MCES mobile smartphone application functionality and usability, as well as added\
    \ content (e.g., medical videos, podcasts, \u201CTell Your Story\u201D feature).\
    \ UMMC plans to create a second \u201CEnhanced First Hands\u201D course and introduce\
    \ the Virtual Patient Interactive Trainer augmented reality system from North\
    \ American Rescue to supplement current training materials. UMMC is also reviewing\
    \ its social media strategy, embarking on a push-to-talk over cellular demonstration,\
    \ and acquiring a ruggedized vehicle to serve as an ambulance for first responders,\
    \ as well as a communications center in tactical or disaster settings.\n\nLastly,\
    \ CISA launched a new technical assistance program entitled the Rural Emergency\
    \ Communications Operational Rapid Assistance Package (O-RAP) to implement REMCDP\
    \ successes in rural communities across the nation. O-RAP objectives are to identify\
    \ immediate needs associated with emergency communications for rural medical care;\
    \ provide tools such as plans, policies, and procedures to quickly address identified\
    \ needs; train jurisdictions and communities on using the provided tools; and\
    \ apply and test those tools via tabletop or functional exercises. To date, CISA\
    \ has engaged with 19 rural communities and tribes to conduct O-RAP and tailor\
    \ REMCDP lessons learned to their unique areas, including customization to regional\
    \ land mobile radio systems and talk-groups. In addition, CISA is planning to\
    \ expand training to incorporate REMCDP innovative solutions, life-saving techniques\
    \ (e.g., CPR, tourniquet application), and medical communications procedures to\
    \ first responders and telecommunicators in rural areas."

- description: "Fiscal Year 2023: Congress authorized another round of REMCDP funding.\
    \ CISA developed the FY 2023 REMCDP Notice of Funding Opportunity with modifications\
    \ from previous years to expand the applicant pool (i.e., adding state, local,\
    \ tribal, and territorial governments in collaboration with a medical facility)\
    \ and award as cooperative agreements (i.e., distinguishing CISA\u2019s substantial\
    \ involvement with recipients to develop innovative solutions and technical assistance\
    \ offerings for other rural communities). A total of $4M will be made available\
    \ for up to two recipients. The period of performance will be two years. Other\
    \ program requirements remain similar to previous REMCDP awards (e.g., no cost\
    \ share or pass-through). The announcement is anticipated for mid-2023. \n\nThe\
    \ FY 2020 REMCDP award closed on April 30, 2023, following DHS approval of a no-cost\
    \ extension request by the recipient. CISA will develop a closeout report following\
    \ the submission of final financial and performance reports in mid-2023. Work\
    \ on the FY 2022 REMCDP award will continue during its two-year period of performance.\
    \ CISA will also continue O-RAP technical assistance with partnered communities."
