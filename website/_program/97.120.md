objective: "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) assigns CISA with the responsibilities\
  \ of promoting the ability of emergency response providers and relevant government\
  \ officials to continue to communicate in the event of disasters, fostering the\
  \ development of interoperable emergency communications capabilities, and promoting\
  \ the development of standard operating procedures and best practices for using\
  \ interoperable emergency communications capabilities for incident response. The\
  \ HSA also assigns CISA with the responsibility to develop and update a National\
  \ Emergency Communication Plan (NECP) to support and promote the ability of emergency\
  \ response providers and relevant government officials to continue to communicate\
  \ in the event of disasters. \n \nTo carry out these responsibilities, CISA established\
  \ the REMCDP to make cooperative agreements to non-federal entities to pursue rural\
  \ emergency medical communications demonstration projects to meet various program\
  \ objectives: (1) enhancing current statewide or regional emergency communications\
  \ systems to address NECP implementation gaps and deliver rural medical care and\
  \ services; (2) developing trainings and exercises to enable first responders and\
  \ personnel to effectively use emergency medical communications system and equipment;\
  \ (3) collaborating with whole community representatives to support NECP activities;\
  \ (4) collaborating with state leaders to address the adoption of broadband communications\
  \ to supplement current communications systems; (5) experimenting with innovative\
  \ solutions to ensure emergency responders and medical practitioners can communicate\
  \ in various geographies, operating conditions, and scenarios; and (6) identifying,\
  \ documenting, and sharing lessons learned and best practices. The REMCDP supports\
  \ Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience in the 2020-2024 Department of\
  \ Homeland Security Strategic Plan and Goal 2: Risk Reduction and Resilience in\
  \ the CISA Strategic Plan 2023-2025."

    \ their grant activities and closed out their grant.  An award for the Rural Medical\
    \ Emergency Communications Demonstration Project will be made. \r\n The grant\
    \ recipient, University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), began developing\
    \ the First Hands Project, a training program designed to use medical education\
    \ along with communications education and exercises to empower first providers\
    \ giving medical care in rural communities. Accomplishments included: Began the\
    \ search to hire staff such as the program manager and field support specialists,\
    \ started outreach and engagement with public safety groups throughout the state\
    \ regarding the First Hands training program, designed and developed First Hands\
    \ Training program content and objectives, procured six vehicles to be located\
    \ at Mississippi Center for Emergency Services’ operational bases to support First\
    \ Hands training travel across the state, and evaluated options and solutions\
    \ for capturing and evaluating participant feedback on the First Hands training\
    \ program, as well as baseline comparison data on current emergency communications\
    \ practices."

    activities for the REMCDP were reported and reviewed each quarter consistent with
    the established program objectives.  The First Hands Program trained 6,088 participants
    total in 333 courses, between January, 2017 and December 31, 2019.  Also, the
    grant recipient hosted 13 First Hands refresher courses for two federal law enforcement
    agencies.

  year: '2020'
- description: Grant activities for FY 2020 REMCDP reporting requirements continue
    to be submitted each quarter. The program reviews the grant activities that support
    emergency responders and medical practitioners so they can communicate in rural,
    underserved communities. The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) reported
    on its First Hands and First Voice Programs, including the successful implementation
    of the online First Voice course to reach the intended telecommunicator audience
    in a safe manner. UMMC also reported progress toward identifying a new platform
    for its Mississippi Center for Emergency Services (MCES) mobile smartphone application
    and acquiring production equipment to create additional content for the application.
    UMMC submitted a budget modification, and no-cost extension through February 28,
    2023, to meet the backlog of training requests that accumulated through the COVID-19
    pandemic shutdown in 2020 and early 2021. DHS approved this request in January
    2022.

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2022: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
    (CISA) published the FY 2022 REMCDP Notice of Funding Opportunity on June 1, 2022.
    The extended application period closed on July 29, 2022, and CISA completed a
    merit-based review process and awarded $1,892,500 in September 2022 to the University
    of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC). UMMC submits quarterly financial and performance
    reports and communicates regularly with CISA. In addition, CISA conducted a site
    visit at UMMC facilities in Jackson, MS, on December 2, 2022, including discussion
    of programmatic monitoring, inventory of equipment purchased with REMDCP funds
    (e.g., radio cache, radio asset distribution vehicles, training supplies, audio/visual
    production, bleeding control kits), and review of FY 2022 award plans and panel
    feedback. As a continuation from previous awards, UMMC offered the online First
    Voice course and conducted in-person First Hands courses for first responders
    across Mississippi. UMMC completed updates to the MCES mobile smartphone application
    functionality and usability, as well as added content (e.g., medical videos, podcasts,
    “Tell Your Story” feature). UMMC plans to create a second “Enhanced First Hands”
    course and introduce the Virtual Patient Interactive Trainer augmented reality
    system from North American Rescue to supplement current training materials. UMMC
    is also reviewing its social media strategy, embarking on a push-to-talk over
    cellular demonstration, and acquiring a ruggedized vehicle to serve as an ambulance
    for first responders, as well as a communications center in tactical or disaster
    settings.


    Lastly, CISA launched a new technical assistance program entitled the Rural Emergency
    Communications Operational Rapid Assistance Package (O-RAP) to implement REMCDP
    successes in rural communities across the nation. O-RAP objectives are to identify
    immediate needs associated with emergency communications for rural medical care;
    provide tools such as plans, policies, and procedures to quickly address identified
    needs; train jurisdictions and communities on using the provided tools; and apply
    and test those tools via tabletop or functional exercises. To date, CISA has engaged
    with 19 rural communities and tribes to conduct O-RAP and tailor REMCDP lessons
    learned to their unique areas, including customization to regional land mobile
    radio systems and talk-groups. In addition, CISA is planning to expand training
    to incorporate REMCDP innovative solutions, life-saving techniques (e.g., CPR,
    tourniquet application), and medical communications procedures to first responders
    and telecommunicators in rural areas.'
