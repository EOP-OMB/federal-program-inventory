cfda: '97.120'
layout: program
objective: "The 97.120 CFDA was used in FY 2016 for the newly authorized Rural Emergency\
  \ Medical Communications Demonstration Project (REMCDP) and again in FY 2018, 2020,\
  \ 2022, and 2023 to reestablish the grant.  The grant opportunity leverages emergency\
  \ communications infrastructure, improves operational effectiveness, addresses National\
  \ Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) implementation gaps, and provides communications\
  \ training and education to enable improved rural medical services.  \n\nThe Presidential\
  \ Policy Directive\u20138 emphasizes national preparedness as a shared responsibility\
  \ of the whole community, requiring greater involvement across multiple jurisdictions\
  \ and disciplines.  REMCDP aids in meeting that goal by working with up to two public\
  \ and state-controlled institutions of higher education, states, U.S. territories,\
  \ local governments (e.g. county, city, or township), or Federally-recognized Tribal\
  \ governments in collaboration with a medical facility to examine communications\
  \ barriers and identify solutions that enhance existing emergency communications\
  \ infrastructure to improve the delivery of rural medical care and address NECP\
  \ implementation gaps."
