objective: "Section 9212 of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), PL 114-95 establishes\
  \ the Preschool Development Grants (PDG). This award seeks to assist states (including\
  \ territories) in helping low-income and disadvantaged children enter Kindergarten\
  \ prepared and ready to succeed in school and to help improve the transitions from\
  \ the early care and education setting to elementary school. The overall responsibility\
  \ of the ESSA PDG is to assist states (including territories) in the coordination\
  \ of their existing early childhood service delivery models and funding streams\
  \ - for the purpose of serving more children birth through age five in a mixed delivery\
  \ model. The ESSA PDG has three targeted purposes. It aims to:  \n\n\"(1) assist\
  \ States to develop, update, or implement a strategic plan that facilitates collaboration\
  \ and coordination among existing programs of early childhood care and education\
  \ in a mixed delivery system across the State designed to prepare low-income and\
  \ disadvantaged children to enter kindergarten and to improve transitions from such\
  \ system into the local educational agency or elementary school that enrolls such\
  \ children, byâ€”\n(A) more efficiently using existing Federal, State, local, and\
  \ non-governmental resources to align and strengthen the delivery of existing programs,\
  \ \n(B) coordinating the delivery models and funding streams existing in the State's\
  \ mixed delivery system; and \n(C) developing recommendations to better use existing\
  \ resources in order to improve-- \n(i) the overall participation of children in\
  \ a mixed delivery system of Federal, State, and local early childhood education\
  \ programs;\n(ii) program quality while maintaining availability of services;\n\
  (iii) parental choice among existing programs; and \n(iv) school readiness for children\
  \ from low- income and disadvantaged families, including during such children's\
  \ transition into elementary school;\n\n(2) encourage partnerships among Head Start\
  \ providers, State and local governments, Indian tribes and tribal organizations,\
  \ private entities (including faith- and community- based entities), and local educational\
  \ agencies, to improve coordination, program quality, and delivery of services;\
  \ and\n\n(3) maximize parental choice among a mixed delivery system of early childhood\
  \ education program providers.\" [Note to 42 USC 9831(a)]\n\nThe PDG B-5 Planning\
  \ Grants are one-year awards allowing states and territories to develop and implement\
  \ a comprehensive, statewide, birth through five needs assessment.  States and territories\
  \ then develop a related strategic plan that also addresses activities that lead\
  \ to more meaningful parent engagement, the sharing of resources and best practices\
  \ among the different early childhood program providers, and improvements in overall\
  \ quality, specific to each state's developmental goals. \n\nThe PDG B-5 Renewal\
  \ Grants are three-year awards that allow states and territories to implement their\
  \  strategic plans and periodically update their needs assessments and related strategic\
  \ plans. The renewal recipients continue to improve their coordination and collaboration\
  \ of programs, services, and systems, while focusing on data integration, ongoing\
  \ monitoring and evaluation, and improvement of governance structures, policy development,\
  \ and stakeholder engagement."
