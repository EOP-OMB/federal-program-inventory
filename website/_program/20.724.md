objective: "The CAAP initiative is intended to spur innovation by enabling an academic\
  \ research focus on high-risk and high pay-off solutions for the many pipeline safety\
  \ challenges. It will potentially deliver solutions that can be \u201Chand-offs\u201D\
  \ to PHMSA\u2019s core research program of demonstration and deployment. The goal\
  \ would be to validate proof of concept of a thesis or theory all the way to commercial\
  \ introduction into the market. Further, the pipeline industry and federal/state\
  \ regulators are experiencing low numbers of applicants to entry level positions\
  \ that are technically focused. As such, another goal of the CAAP program is to\
  \ expose graduate and PhD research students to subject matter that is common to\
  \ pipeline safety challenges and to illustrate how their engineering or technical\
  \ disciplines are highly needed in the field. The ultimate benefit would be to cultivate\
  \ new talent in all aspects of pipelines, similar to how programs at other Federal\
  \ Agencies and non-profit organizations have encouraged talent to consider a career\
  \ in a certain field."
