objective: The CAAP initiative is intended to spur innovation by enabling an academic
  research focus on high-risk and high pay-off solutions for the many pipeline safety
  challenges. It will potentially deliver solutions that can be “hand-offs” to PHMSA’s
  core research program of demonstration and deployment. The goal would be to validate
  proof of concept of a thesis or theory all the way to commercial introduction into
  the market. Further, the pipeline industry and federal/state regulators are experiencing
  low numbers of applicants to entry level positions that are technically focused.
  As such, another goal of the CAAP program is to expose graduate and PhD research
  students to subject matter that is common to pipeline safety challenges and to illustrate
  how their engineering or technical disciplines are highly needed in the field. The
  ultimate benefit would be to cultivate new talent in all aspects of pipelines, similar
  to how programs at other Federal Agencies and non-profit organizations have encouraged
  talent to consider a career in a certain field.

- description: 'TBD Three (3) new research awards issued with allowable funds. '
  year: '2016'
- description: To date, 154 students have been involved in pipeline research at US
    universities as a result of the CAAP program.  Six have gone on to internships,
    and seven full time employment in pipeline technology fields as a direct result
    of their participation.
  year: '2017'
- description: Funded several research projects in the areas of Detecting, Mitigating
    and/or locating internal Pipeline Corrosion, Develop advanced knowledge base models
    from Root Cause Failure Analysis of past pipeline incidents, and Engineering improvements
    to Pipeline Computational Models to Reduce Variance.

  year: '2020'
- description: 'Fiscal Year 2022: PHMSA anticipates awarding six new CAAP research
    projects within the following solicited topic areas of the NOFO: 1. Excessive
    Cathodic Protection on Vintage Pipelines; 2. Development of Structural Liner Material;
    3. Pipeline Infrastructure Modernization – Hydrogen Network; and 4. Determination

  year: '2021'
- description: "Through the CAAP, PHMSA built research and innovation partnerships\
    \ with 26 universities and research organizations since its inception in 2013.\
    \ Over 370 students have been exposed to the pipeline safety field through the\
    \ program. Among these more than 20 students have received internship or employment\
    \ offered by engineering firms, research organizations, government agencies or\
    \ pipeline operators. \nThe CAAP ensures inclusivity through outreach communication\
    \ of funding research opportunities to all higher education institutions, including\
    \ Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), such as Historically Black Colleges and\
    \ Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Asian-American, Native American,\
    \ and Pacific Island-Serving Institutions. PHMSA strongly encourages universities\
    \ to partner with MSIs in their grant proposals."
  year: '2022'
- description: In late March and early April 2023, PHMSA conducted two informational
    sessions with MSIs on the CAAP. Since 2013, 10 MSIs have submitted proposals in
    the CAAP.
