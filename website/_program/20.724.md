objective: "The CAAP initiative is intended to spur innovation by enabling an academic\
  \ research focus on high-risk and high pay-off solutions for the many pipeline safety\
  \ challenges. It will potentially deliver solutions that can be \u201Chand-offs\u201D\
  \ to PHMSA\u2019s core research program of demonstration and deployment. The goal\
  \ would be to validate proof of concept of a thesis or theory all the way to commercial\
  \ introduction into the market. Further, the pipeline industry and federal/state\
  \ regulators are experiencing low numbers of applicants to entry level positions\
  \ that are technically focused. As such, another goal of the CAAP program is to\
  \ expose graduate and PhD research students to subject matter that is common to\
  \ pipeline safety challenges and to illustrate how their engineering or technical\
  \ disciplines are highly needed in the field. The ultimate benefit would be to cultivate\
  \ new talent in all aspects of pipelines, similar to how programs at other Federal\
  \ Agencies and non-profit organizations have encouraged talent to consider a career\
  \ in a certain field."

- description: "Through the CAAP, PHMSA built research and innovation partnerships\
    \ with 26 universities and research organizations since its inception in 2013.\
    \ Over 370 students have been exposed to the pipeline safety field through the\
    \ program. Among these more than 20 students have received internship or employment\
    \ offered by engineering firms, research organizations, government agencies or\
    \ pipeline operators. \nThe CAAP ensures inclusivity through outreach communication\
    \ of funding research opportunities to all higher education institutions, including\
    \ Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), such as Historically Black Colleges and\
    \ Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Asian-American, Native American,\
    \ and Pacific Island-Serving Institutions. PHMSA strongly encourages universities\
    \ to partner with MSIs in their grant proposals."
  year: '2022'
- description: In late March and early April 2023, PHMSA conducted two informational
    sessions with MSIs on the CAAP. Since 2013, 10 MSIs have submitted proposals in
    the CAAP.
