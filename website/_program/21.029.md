results:
- description: CPF recipients began investing grant funding in capital infrastructure
    projects. Many states are using their funding to connect thousands of homes and
    businesses to affordable, high-speed internet, a key priority of the CPF program.
    Other states are using their funds to construct or renovate multi-purpose community
    facilities to provide increased access to resources and programming for community
    members. Tribal governments continue to use their funding to purchase digital
    connectivity devices, build multi-purpose community facilities, or construct broadband
    infrastructure.
