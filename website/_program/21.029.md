results:
- description: CPF recipients began investing grant funding in capital infrastructure.  Many
    states are using their funding to connect thousands of homes and businesses to
    affordable, high-speed internet, a key priority of the Capital Projects Fund program.
    Other states are using their funds to construct or renovate multi-purpose community
    facilities to provide increased access to resources and programming for community
    members. Tribal governments continue to use their funding to purchase digital
    connectivity devices, build multi-purpose community facilities, or construct broadband
    infrastructure.
