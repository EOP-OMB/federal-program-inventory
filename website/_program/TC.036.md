objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code provided an investment tax credit
  for expenditures made on insulation, exterior windows, and doors that improved the
  energy efficiency of homes and met certain standards. The Tax Code also provided
  a credit for purchases of advanced main air circulating fans, natural gas, propane,
  or oil furnaces or hot water boilers, and other qualified energy efficient property.
  This provision expired on December 31, 2017, but legislation enacted in 2020 allowed
  taxpayers to claim tax credits retroactively for three years. The credit was further
  increased up to $3,200 and extended to homes acquired in 2023 through 2032.
