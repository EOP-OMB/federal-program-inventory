objective: 'The purpose of this program is to improve health outcomes for older adults
  by developing a healthcare workforce that maximizes patient and family engagement,
  and by integrating geriatrics and primary care. The goals of this program are: 1)
  to educate and train the primary care and geriatrics workforce to care for older
  adults in integrated geriatrics and primary care models, and 2) to partner with
  community based organizations (CBOs) to address gaps in healthcare for older adults,
  promote age-friendly health systems and dementia-friendly communities, and address
  the social determinants of health.'

- description: In Academic Year 2017-2018, GWEP grantees provided training for 49,381
    students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics-focused degree programs,
    field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees, 26,966 graduated or completed
    their training during the current academic year. GWEP grantees partnered with
    316 health care delivery sites (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, and
    academic institutions) to provide clinical training experiences to trainees. Approximately
    43 percent of these sites were located in medically underserved communities, and
    53 percent were situated in primary care settings. With regard to the continuing
    education of the current workforce, 212,444 faculty and practicing professionals
    participated in 1,564 unique continuing education courses offered by GWEP 120
    grantees,

    students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics-focused degree programs,
    field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees, 31,522 graduated or completed
    their training during the current academic year. GWEP grantees partnered with
    307 health care delivery sites (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, and
    academic institutions) to provide clinical training experiences to trainees. Approximately
    56 percent of these sites were located in medically underserved communities, and
    54 percent were primary care settings. With regard to the continuing education
    of the current workforce, 187,955 faculty and practicing professionals participated
    in 1,342 unique continuing education courses offered by GWEP grantees, 445 of
    which were specifically focused on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, just
    missing the target of 500.  In addition, GWEP grantees developed or enhanced and
    implemented 4,313 different curricular activities. Most of these were new continuing
    education courses, academic courses, and workshops, which together reached 142,022
    people. Finally, with regard to faculty development, results showed that GWEP
    grantees supported 372 different faculty-focused training programs and activities
    during the academic year, reaching 11,406 faculty-level trainees.
  year: '2019'
- description: All 48 GWEP grantees have worked with primary care clinics, academic
    school of health professions, and community-based organizations to promote telehealth
    for home-bound older adults, nursing home residents, their families and their
    caregivers in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  year: '2020'
- description: "In Academic Year 2020-2021, GWEP awardees provided training for 69,518\
    \ students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics-focused degree\
    \ programs, field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees, 61,994 graduated\
    \ or completed their training during this time frame. \n\nGWEP awardees partnered\
    \ with 262 health care delivery sites (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities,\
    \ and academic institutions) to provide clinical training experiences to trainees.\
    \ Approximately 52 percent of these sites were located in medically underserved\
    \ communities, 48 percent were in primary care settings, and 29 percent were in\
    \ rural areas. Sixty-three percent of sites offered COVID-19 related services,\
    \ 61 percent offered telehealth services, and 30 percent provided integrated behavioral\
    \ health services in a primary care setting. \nAwardees also developed or enhanced\
    \ 5,967 courses, which reached over 720,000 students. Courses covered topics such\
    \ as Alzheimer’s disease/dementia (23 percent), geriatric health (22 percent),\
    \ and evidence-based practice in a clinical setting (7 percent). In addition,\
    \ GWEP awardees supported health care professionals by providing over 4,500 hours\
    \ of training across 1,857 continuing education courses. Nearly 520,000 health\
    \ care professionals participated in GWEP-sponsored continuing education courses\
    \ and approximately 16 percent of these professionals were employed in medically\
    \ underserved communities. Thirty-nine percent of GWEP continuing education courses\
    \ focused on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Furthermore, GWEP awardees\
    \ supported 483 faculty-focused training programs and activities, reaching 9,912\
    \ faculty-level trainees.\n\nGWEP significantly outperformed nearly all of its\
    \ targets this year, sponsoring 721 Alzheimer’s disease and dementia-related educational\
    \ offerings (6.I.C.12), training 180,938 individuals through Alzheimer’s disease\
    \ and dementia-related educational offerings (6.I.C.13), reaching 519,356 geriatrics\
    \ professionals through continuing education programs (6.I.C.32), and providing\
    \ 69,518 students with geriatric-focused training in settings across the care\
    \ continuum (6.I.C.33). The targets were 150; 10,000; 50,000; and 10,000 respectively.\
    \ Awardees also reached 721,148 trainees through curricula related to treating\
    \ health problems in elderly individuals, exceeding the FY 2020 target (not depicted\
    \ in the program activity table) of 140,000 trainees. This shift occurred because\
    \ awardees moved to online courses for health care professionals and to telehealth-based\
    \ training for students unable to access clinical training sites. Awardees also\
    \ established new relationships with the nation’s 15,000+ nursing homes, in response\
    \ to COVID-19’s impact on nursing homes and geriatric patients. These awardees\
    \ leveraged the new delivery modes and relationships to expand their activities,\
    \ such as offering online continuing education courses on Alzheimer’s disease\
    \ and dementia to nursing home-based health care providers. \n\nIn FY 2021, the\
    \ GWEP program received an additional $2 million in annual appropriations. The\
    \ funding provided COVID-19 specific education and training to the nursing home\
    \ workforce in order to improve care to nursing home residents.\n\nGWEP awardees\
    \ used COVID-19 supplemental funding to offer a variety of courses and continuing\
    \ education classes to help students and professionals respond to the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic. With this supplemental funding, awardees developed or enhanced 979\
    \ courses for nearly 470,000 students, including 149 courses on geriatric health\
    \ and 74 courses on telehealth in clinical settings. GWEP awardees also offered\
    \ nearly 3,000 hours of continuing education across 668 classes, reaching over\
    \ 360,000 individuals. Fifty-four percent of these trainings addressed issues\
    \ related to Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Awardees also reached 4,501 faculty-level\
    \ trainees through 129 faculty-focused training programs and activities."
  year: '2021'
- description: In Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022, the most recent year for which performance
    data is available, GWEP trained over one million health care professionals, students,
