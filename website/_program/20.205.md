objective: "This Assistance Listing encompasses several transportation programs: \n\
  \n1) Federal-aid Highway Program: The purpose of the Federal-aid Highway Program\
  \ is to assist the States in providing for construction, preservation, and improvement\
  \ of highways and bridges on eligible Federal-Aid routes, (including the National\
  \ Highway System (NHS) - an integrated, interconnected transportation system important\
  \ to interstate commerce and travel), and for other special purpose programs and\
  \ projects.  This program also provides for the construction and improvement of\
  \ highways in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth\
  \ of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\n2) The Federal\
  \ Lands Highway Program: The Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) provides\
  \ assistance to the Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) for Federally-owned\
  \ roads and trails. It provides transportation engineering services and funding\
  \ for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges\
  \ that are on or provide access to federally owned lands. The Federal Lands Highway\
  \ organization also provides training, technology deployment, and engineering services\
  \ to other customers. \n\n3) The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (IIJA) Act also\
  \ known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is a once-in-a-generation investment\
  \ in our infrastructure that will help grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness,\
  \ create good jobs, and build our safe, resilient, and equitable transportation\
  \ future.  BIL provides the basis for FHWA programs and activities through September\
  \ 30, 2026.  It makes an investment of $350 billion in highway programs. This includes\
  \ the largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate\
  \ Highway System.  New programs under the BIL focus on key infrastructure priorities\
  \ including rehabilitating bridges in critical need of repair, reducing carbon emissions,\
  \ increasing system resilience, removing barriers to connecting communities, and\
  \ improving mobility and access to economic opportunity.  Many of the new programs\
  \ include eligibility for local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations\
  \ (MPOs), Tribes, and other public authorities, allowing them to compete directly\
  \ for funding.  BIL also continues to focus the program on safety and performance-based\
  \ investment and on accelerating project delivery through expedited environmental\
  \ review and elimination of duplicate processes.\n\n4) The Highway Infrastructure\
  \ Programs in the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2018, included\
  \ two new discretionary programs:  Competitive Bridge Program and Nationally Significant\
  \ Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program.  The Competitive Bridge Program was\
  \ appropriated $225 million to be used for highway bridge rehabilitation or replacement\
  \ projects for States that have a population density of less than 100 individuals\
  \ per square mile and that demonstrate cost savings by bundling multiple highway\
  \ bridge projects."
