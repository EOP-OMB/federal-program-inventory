objective: "Goal:  Funding under the program is intended to support law enforcement,\
  \ prosecutorial, and correctional agencies seeking to establish, expand, or enhance\
  \ comprehensive Body-Worn Camera (BWC) programs and have specified plans to implement\
  \ this technology in a manner that maximizes the benefits of BWCs in that agency\
  \ setting. Both individual and partnership applications are encouraged.  \n\nObjectives:\
  \ Promote officer and citizen safety through comprehensive and policy-driven BWC\
  \ deployments that when properly implemented may help reduce incidents of use of\
  \ force, reduce complaints against officers, and mitigate the lodging of false or\
  \ unfounded complaints by citizens. Promote and strengthen relationships and strategies\
  \ for the administration of justice within law enforcement agencies, and in coordination\
  \ with courts, prosecutors, and public defender.  Improve justice outcomes by providing\
  \ sound and reliable digital media evidence for use by prosecutors, defense attorneys,\
  \ and courts, as well as for internal law enforcement administrative proceedings.\n\
  \nPerformance Measure 1:  Total number of agencies that have received funding to\
  \ acquire BWCs  \n\nPerformance Measure 2:  Total number of BWCs purchased per agency\n\
  \nPerformance Measure 3: Total number of agencies that have improved the management\
  \ and utility of digital evidence generated by BWCs"
