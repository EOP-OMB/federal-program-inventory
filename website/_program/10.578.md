objective: "To assist WIC State agencies, through grants and cooperative agreements,\
  \ in making improvements and/or enhancements to the delivery of program benefits\
  \ and services to participants. These grants and cooperative agreements include\
  \ the following:\n\n1. WIC Breastfeeding Peer Counseling Grants (discretionary)\
  \ are provided to WIC State agencies to implement or maintain effective breastfeeding\
  \ peer counselor programs. Combining peer counseling with the on-going breastfeeding\
  \ promotion and support efforts in WIC agencies has the potential to significantly\
  \ impact breastfeeding rates among WIC participants. The Food and Nutrition Service\u2019\
  s long-range vision is to institutionalize peer counseling as a core service in\
  \ WIC. A portion of these funds may be used to award breastfeeding performance bonuses.\
  \ These incentives build upon WIC\u2019s longstanding efforts to promote and support\
  \ breastfeeding and are intended to recognize and award State agencies that have\
  \ demonstrated successful breastfeeding promotion and support efforts.\n\n2. WIC\
  \ Infrastructure Grants (discretionary) are provided to WIC State agencies for infrastructure\
  \ projects that support national and regional priorities to improve the delivery\
  \ of program benefits and services to participants.\n\n3. WIC Special Project Innovation\
  \ Grants (WSPI), formerly known as the WIC Special Project Grants, as awarded, will\
  \ establish an academic and/or non-profit organization to award sub-grants to WIC\
  \ State and local agencies as they develop, implement, and evaluate new or innovative\
  \ projects to meet the changing needs of WIC participants.  The guiding principles\
  \ of the sub-grants are: build on and improve FNS\u2019 understanding of the diverse\
  \ personal experiences, perceptions, and attitudes of those eligible for WIC services;\
  \ and allow the Program to refine and enhance service delivery and customer service\
  \ based on the understanding of the participant experience.\n\n4.  WIC Implementation\
  \ of Breastfeeding Support Campaign Project to provide technical support for the\
  \ implementation and evaluation of the updated USDA National Breastfeeding Promotion\
  \ Campaign WIC Breastfeeding Support, Learn Together. Grow Together. State agencies\
  \ can use funds to implement and evaluate the updated Campaign to increase the knowledge\
  \ of and to promote behavior change about breastfeeding among WIC staff and participants.\
  \ \n\n5.  WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) and Management Information System\
  \ (MIS) Grants are provided to WIC State agencies for the implementation of WIC\
  \ EBT systems and/or to transfer modern/viable MIS. These grants include: (1) WIC\
  \ EBT Implementation (non-competitive) Grants to support EBT planning or implementation\
  \ projects through the Advanced Planning Document (APD) process; (2) WIC State Agency\
  \ Model (SAM) Amendments (non-competitive) Grants to support WIC State agencies\
  \ in the SAM Users Group; (3) WIC SAM Transfers Grants (non-competitive) to complete\
  \ planning activities and have an approved Alternatives Analysis document justifying\
  \ a SAM as their choice of system transfer; (4) WIC Management Information Systems\
  \ (MIS) Implementation (non-competitive) Grants to implement a transfer MIS or are\
  \ upgrading or enhancing their current MIS; (5) WIC SAM Product Management Office\
  \ (PMO) (non-competitive) and SAM Maintenance and Enhancement (M&E) Grants for the\
  \ support and management of the SAM change control process, including prioritization\
  \ of enhancements, User Group governance, and maintenance and operation of the State\
  \ agency MIS core code."
