objective: "To assist WIC State agencies, through grants and cooperative agreements,\
  \ in making improvements and/or enhancements to the delivery of program benefits\
  \ and services to participants. These grants and cooperative agreements include\
  \ the following:\n\n1. WIC Breastfeeding Peer Counseling Grants (discretionary)\
  \ are provided to WIC State agencies to implement or maintain effective breastfeeding\
  \ peer counselor programs. Combining peer counseling with the on-going breastfeeding\

  \ impact breastfeeding rates among WIC participants. The Food and Nutrition Service’s\
  \ long-range vision is to institutionalize peer counseling as a core service in\
  \ WIC. A portion of these funds may be used to award breastfeeding performance bonuses.\
  \ These incentives build upon WIC’s longstanding efforts to promote and support\
  \ breastfeeding and are intended to recognize and award State agencies that have\
  \ demonstrated successful breastfeeding promotion and support efforts.\n\n2. WIC\
  \ Infrastructure Grants (discretionary) are provided to WIC State agencies for infrastructure\
  \ projects that support national and regional priorities to improve the delivery\
  \ of program benefits and services to participants.\n \n3.  WIC Implementation of\
  \ Breastfeeding Support Campaign Project to provide technical support for the implementation\
  \ and evaluation of the updated USDA National Breastfeeding Promotion Campaign WIC\
  \ Breastfeeding Support, Learn Together. Grow Together. State agencies can use funds\
  \ to implement and evaluate the updated Campaign to increase the knowledge of and\
  \ to promote behavior change about breastfeeding among WIC staff and participants.\
  \ \n\n4.  WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) and Management Information System\
  \ (MIS) Grants were provided to WIC State agencies for the implementation of WIC\
  \ EBT systems and/or to transfer a viable MIS. These grants included: (1) WIC EBT\
