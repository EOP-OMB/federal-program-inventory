objective: 'AmeriCorps is seeking to expand the capacity (knowledge, skills, and resources)
  of State Service Commissions and Alternative Administrative Entities in priority
  performance areas through the Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) Commission
  Investment Funds. These funds support AmeriCorpsâ€™ overall approach to help commissions
  implement their duties as required by the National and Community Service Act of
  1990, as amended. With this grant program, AmeriCorps is particularly interested
  in activities that will forge new collaborations and partnerships or develop new
  skills and knowledge to produce significant and demonstrable improvements within
  the one-year grant period. The Commission Investment Funds may be used to support:
  commission staffing and staff development in priority performance areas; training
  events; and collaborative activities.'
