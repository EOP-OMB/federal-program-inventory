objective: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and
  energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, States and the Native
  American community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural
  gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation’s outer continental
  shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American people and to
  ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources now and into the
  future. The program not only supports decisions made within the Department of the
  Interior, but also provides coastal States and local governments with the information
  necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are
  conducted in a manner to protect both the human and natural environments. Outer
  Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) Section 1346 mandates the conduct of environmental
  and socioeconomic studies needed for the assessment and management of environmental
  impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments which may be affected by
  oil and gas or other mineral development. OCSLA Section 1345 authorizes the use
  of cooperative agreements with affected States to meet the requirements of OCSLA,
  including sharing of information, joint utilization of available expertise, formation
  of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out applicable Federal and State laws,
  regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer continental shelf operations both
  onshore and offshore. The purpose of the Alaska Coastal Marine Institute (CMI) program
  is to use highly qualified scientific expertise at local levels to collect and disseminate
  environmental information needed for OCS oil and gas and marine minerals decisions;
  address local and regional OCS-related environmental and resource issues of mutual
  interest; and strengthen the BOEM-State partnership in addressing OCS oil and gas
  and marine minerals information needs.
