objective: The English for Heritage Language Speakers (EHLS) program is designed to
  provide intensive English language instruction for U. S. citizens who are native
  speakers of critical languages.  The goal of the program is to enable participants
  to reach professional working proficiency in English, as measured by the federal
  Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 3 and/or the American Council on the
  Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) superior level.  The program equips participants
  with the ability to read, write, speak, and listen at a superior level in an effort
  to build a critical base of future leaders to serve in the federal government service
  and the broader professional community.
