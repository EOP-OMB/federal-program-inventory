objective: "In 2022, the Forest Service launched the Wildfire Crisis Strategy to addresses\
  \ wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, to protect communities, and to make\
  \ forests more resilient. The implementation of the strategy and treatment of selected\
  \ landscapes began in 2022. \nIn January 2023, the USDA secretary announced 11 additional\
  \ landscapes, prioritizing protecting underserved communities, critical infrastructure,\
  \ and public water sources, as well as to address risks on land close to tribal\
  \ communities.\nProject work to reduce wildfire risk will span upward of 45 million\
  \ acres across 21 landscapes in the Western United States."
