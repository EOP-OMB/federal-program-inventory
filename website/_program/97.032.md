objective: 'The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) supports the
  Recovery core capability and mission area as defined in the National Preparedness
  Goal. Its objective is to  assist individuals and communities in recovering from
  the challenging effects of natural and human-caused disasters through the provision
  of community-based outreach and psycho-educational services. The CCP goals are to:
  reach large numbers of people affected by disasters through face-to-face outreach
  to shelters, homes, and other locations; â€¢ provide emotional support, education,
  basic crisis counseling, and connection to familial and community support systems;
  train and educate CCP staff and other community partners about disaster reactions,
  appropriate interventions, and CCP services; develop partnerships with local disaster
  and other organizations; work with local stakeholders to promote community resilience
  and recovery; assess the emotional needs of survivors and make referrals to traditional
  behavioral health services when necessary; identify tangible needs and link survivors
  to community resources and disaster relief services; collect and evaluate aggregate,
  anonymized data to ensure quality services and justify program efforts; and leave
  behind a permanent legacy of improved coping skills, educational and resource materials,
  and enhanced community linkages.'
