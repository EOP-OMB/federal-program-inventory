objective: "To make funding available for water recycling and desalination projects.\
  \ To develop and supplement urban and irrigation water supplies through water reuse\
  \ and the treatment of ocean or brackish water—thereby improving efficiency, providing\
  \ flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying water supply portfolios.\
  \ \n\nTitle XVI of P.L. 102-575, as amended (Title XVI), directs the Secretary of\
  \ the Interior, acting through the Commissioner, to undertake a program to identify\
  \ and investigate opportunities to reclaim and reuse wastewaters and impaired ground\
  \ and surface water in the 17 Western States and Hawaii. Title XVI provides authority\
  \ for the Secretary to provide up to 25 percent of the cost of planning, design,\
  \ and construction of water recycling projects, up to $30 million unless otherwise\
  \ specified by Congress, as well as up to 50 percent of the cost of feasibility\
  \ studies.\n\nThe Water Desalination Act of 1996, as amended by P.L. 114-332 provides\
  \ authority for the Secretary to provide up to 25 percent of the cost of planning,\
  \ design, and construction of ocean or brackish water desalination facilities. \n\
  \nSection 40905 of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, P.L. 117-58 provides authority\
  \ for the Secretary to provide up to 25 percent of the cost of planning, design,\
  \ and construction of water recycling projects with a total estimate project cost\
  \ of $500 million or more."

results:
- description: 'Information not available. In FY 2017, six authorized projects received
    $20.9 million for planning design, and construction, $1.7 million was awarded
    for thirteen new Title XVI feasibility studies, and $847,701 was awarded for four
    water reclamation and reuse research projects. Three WIIN projects were also transmitted
    to Congress for a total of $10 million in Federal funding. '
  year: '2017'
- description: "For FY18 and FY19: Some of the Title XVI water reuse benefits include\
    \ improving water-use efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages,\
    \ and diversifying the water supply.  In areas where municipalities and industry\
    \ (M&I) are looking to agriculture as a water source, Title XVI projects reduce\
    \ the need to transfer agricultural water to M&I uses.\n\nFifty-three projects\
    \ are specifically authorized and fifty-six projects are currently eligible under\
    \ the WIIN Act.  Two demonstration projects have also been undertaken through\
    \ the general authority.  Since the program’s inception in 1992, more than $775\
    \ million in Federal cost-share has been leveraged to design and construct water\
    \ recycling projects. \n\nIn FY 2019, Reclamation selected five congressionally\
    \ authorized Title XVI water reuse projects to receive $16.98 million in FY 2019\
    \ Federal funding. Reclamation also selected four Title XVI Water Reuse Research\
    \ Projects to receive $1.6 million in FY 2019 funding. FY 2019 WIIN Act Title\
    \ XVI project recommendations ($20 million) are currently under review and have\
    \ not yet been transmitted to Congress.\n\nIn FY 2018, six authorized projects\
    \ received approximately $35.3 million from FY2018 appropriations and a small\
    \ amount from previous year funding for planning, design, and construction. Six\
    \ Title XVI WIIN projects were also transmitted to Congress for a total of $20\
    \ million in Federal funding."
