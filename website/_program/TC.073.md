objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income. Under current law, capital gains on assets held for
  more than one year are taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than
  20 percent (plus the 3.8 percent surtax).
