objective: The MPPRI Program is part of the broader USDA investment to transform the
  food supply chain. Given that the meat and poultry processing sector is particularly
  vulnerable to disruption, increasing capacity and promoting competition in this
  sector is a high priority for USDA. Therefore, the USDA MPPRI awards will provide
  grants as equity-free (non-diluted) funding to promote private sector companies
  with SBIR/STTR Phase I/II success for the integration of technology that has been
  developed, with minimal additional research required, to impact technology advancements
  and adoption to benefit the supply chain resilience of small and mid-size meat and
  poultry processors.
