objective: 'The MPPRI Program is part of the broader USDA investment to transform
  the food supply chain. Given that the meat and poultry processing sector is particularly
  vulnerable to disruption, increasing capacity and promoting competition in this
  sector is a high priority for USDA. Therefore, the USDA MPPRI awards will provide
  grants as equity-free (non-diluted) funding to promote private sector companies
  with SBIR/STTR Phase I/II success for the integration of technology that has been
  developed, with minimal additional research required, to impact technology advancements
  and adoption to benefit the supply chain resilience of small and mid-size meat and
  poultry processors.

  2

  The goal of this directed Request for Applications (RFA) is to make emerging technologies
  more accessible to small and mid-size processors through work with small business
  innovators that have demonstrated significant efficacy in development and advancements
  towards commercialization of relevant technology. Eligible meat and poultry processing
  channels include independent business owners, entrepreneurs, producers, and other
  groups, such as cooperatives and worker associations who are less resourced. Awards
  will be made to select technology providers that are past SBIR/STTR Phase I/II recipients
  that can provide rapid technological advancements to small and mid-size processors
  in three priority areas:

  1. Monitoring and improving complex processes,

  2. Worker safety, and

  3. Food safety.

  The purpose of a research application is to provide a written statement that contains
  sufficient information to objectively ascertain that the proposed activities demonstrate
  a sound approach to an innovation that answers both a scientific question and has
  a strong potential to be commercialized. Selection of awardees will be an expedited
  and opportunistic process by NIFA and USDA staff based upon 1) appropriate fit to
  at least one of the three priority areas and 2) likelihood of impact to meeting
  the Secretary’s objectives. A peer/external review panel will not be used. The awardees
  will have other requirements to validate their eligibility, and yet other criteria
  may be selected relevant to the Secretary’s guidance based upon the number of select
  invitees that apply.'
