objective: "The MPPRI Program is part of the broader USDA investment to transform\
  \ the food supply chain. Given that the meat and poultry processing sector is particularly\
  \ vulnerable to disruption, increasing capacity and promoting competition in this\
  \ sector is a high priority for USDA. Therefore, the USDA MPPRI awards will provide\
  \ grants as equity-free (non-diluted) funding to promote private sector companies\
  \ with SBIR/STTR Phase I/II success for the integration of technology that has been\
  \ developed, with minimal additional research required, to impact technology advancements\
  \ and adoption to benefit the supply chain resilience of small and mid-size meat\
  \ and poultry processors.\n2\nThe goal of this directed Request for Applications\
  \ (RFA) is to make emerging technologies more accessible to small and mid-size processors\
  \ through work with small business innovators that have demonstrated significant\
  \ efficacy in development and advancements towards commercialization of relevant\
  \ technology. Eligible meat and poultry processing channels include independent\
  \ business owners, entrepreneurs, producers, and other groups, such as cooperatives\
  \ and worker associations who are less resourced. Awards will be made to select\
  \ technology providers that are past SBIR/STTR Phase I/II recipients that can provide\
  \ rapid technological advancements to small and mid-size processors in three priority\
  \ areas:\n1. Monitoring and improving complex processes,\n2. Worker safety, and\n\
  3. Food safety.\nThe purpose of a research application is to provide a written statement\
  \ that contains sufficient information to objectively ascertain that the proposed\
  \ activities demonstrate a sound approach to an innovation that answers both a scientific\
  \ question and has a strong potential to be commercialized. Selection of awardees\
  \ will be an expedited and opportunistic process by NIFA and USDA staff based upon\
  \ 1) appropriate fit to at least one of the three priority areas and 2) likelihood\
  \ of impact to meeting the Secretary\u2019s objectives. A peer/external review panel\
  \ will not be used. The awardees will have other requirements to validate their\
  \ eligibility, and yet other criteria may be selected relevant to the Secretary\u2019\
  s guidance based upon the number of select invitees that apply."
