objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However,
  the Tax Code provides for the issuance of energy conservation bonds which entitle
  the bond holder to a Federal income tax credit in lieu of interest. As of March
  2010, issuers of the unused authorization of such bonds could opt to receive direct
  payment with the yield becoming fully taxable.
