- description: ' In 2008, Congress mandated PTC implementation on the main lines of
    Class I railroads and entities providing regularly scheduled intercity or commuter
    rail passenger transportation over which any poisonous or toxic by inhalation
    hazardous materials are transported, or over which intercity or commuter rail
    passenger transportation is regularly provided.  Since Congress extended the original
    PTC implementation deadline from December 31, 2015 to at least December 31, 2018,
    these grants will help make the nationâ€™s rail system safer by facilitating deployment
    of PTC collision avoidance systems.'
  year: '2016'
- description: 'These grants will continue to facilitate the implementation of PTC
    that prevents certain train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions
    into established work zone limits, and trains going to the wrong tracks due to
    improper switching.  Many grant projects will help railroads achieve interoperability
    among the different PTC systems that railroads are deploying. '
  year: '2017'
- description: Seventeen Positive Train Control (PTC) grant projects are underway,
    and seven PTC projects  have been completed under this grant program.
  year: '2018'
- description: Fourteen Positive Train Control (PTC) grant projects are underway,
    and eleven PTC projects have been completed under this grant program.
  year: '2019'
- description: 11 Positive Train Control (PTC) grant projects are underway, and fourteen
    PTC projects have been completed under this grant program to facilitate the implementation
    of PTC.
  year: '2020'
- description: In FY 2021, FRA completed and closed 4 PTC projects that facilitate
    the implementation of PTC that prevents certain train-to-train collisions, over-speed
    derailments, incursions into established work zone limits, and trains going to
    the wrong tracks due to improper switching. Many grant projects will help railroads
    achieve interoperability among the different PTC systems that railroads are deploying.
    FRA does not anticipate receiving future funding appropriations for this program.
  year: '2021'
- description: In FY 2022, FRA anticipates completing 3 of the remaining PTC projects
    that facilitate the implementation of PTC that prevents certain train-to-train
    collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits,
    and trains going to the wrong tracks due to improper switching. Many grant projects
    will help railroads achieve interoperability among the different PTC systems that
    railroads are deploying.  FRA does not anticipate receiving future funding appropriations
    for this program.
  year: '2022'
- description: FRA does not anticipate any further funding appropriations or grant
    obligations under this Assistance Listing Number.  FRA anticipates closing all
    remaining grants under the program and archiving the Assistance Listing by the
    end of 2023.  The last grant obligation under the Assistance Listing occurred
    in 2018.
  year: '2023'
- description: FRA does not anticipate any further funding appropriations or grant
    obligations under this Assistance Listing Number. FRA anticipates closing all
    remaining grants under the program and archiving the Assistance Listing by the
    end of 2023. The last grant obligation under the Assistance Listing occurred in
    2018.
