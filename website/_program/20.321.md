results:
- description: In FY 2022, FRA anticipates completing 3 of the remaining PTC projects
    that facilitate the implementation of PTC that prevents certain train-to-train
    collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits,
    and trains going to the wrong tracks due to improper switching. Many grant projects
    will help railroads achieve interoperability among the different PTC systems that
    railroads are deploying.  FRA does not anticipate receiving future funding appropriations
    for this program.
