objective: The AmeriCorps Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement (DRCA) is an initiative
  through which national service programs provide support to communities affected
  by disaster and are reimbursed for expenses in times of disasters. Programs that
  hold a DRCA are part of the AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team (A-DRT) Program, a
  national service disaster focused program. Only programs with an executed Disaster
  Response Cooperative Agreement will be eligible for deployment and reimbursement
  of expenses. Through the A-DRT Program, AmeriCorps establishes cooperative agreements
  with eligible organizations that can provide national service participants to support
  disaster response. Organizations that want to be part of the A-DRT Program must
  be AmeriCorps grantees and sub-grantees, to include AmeriCorps State, AmeriCorps
  Seniors, State Service Commissions, and AmeriCorps National Direct. Only programs
  with an executed Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement will be eligible for deployment
  and reimbursement of expenses.
