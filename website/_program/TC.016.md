objective: The baseline tax system allows taxpayers to deduct the decline in the economic
  value of an investment over its economic life. However, the Tax Code allows geological
  and geophysical expenditures incurred in connection with oil and gas exploration
  in the United States to be amortized over two years for non-integrated oil companies,
  a span of time that is generally shorter than the economic life of the assets.
