objective: BIL funds will be used to modernize state, territorial, and tribal nursery
  and tree orchard facilities.  This investment can support capital improvements to
  facilities, purchase supplies, improving seedling production, maintenance or upgrade
  of equipment and increase production capacity to help these facilities address future
  reforestation and seed/seedling needs. Funding can also be used to cover salary,
  training, travel and contract labor in the production of seedlings or seed activities.
