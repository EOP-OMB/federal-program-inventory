objective: The purpose of the Research and Evaluation (R&E) Program is to further
  develop and make maximum use of the evidence base for approaches to combatting domestic
  violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. By generating more knowledge
  about strategies for serving victims and holding offenders accountable, communities
  that benefit from VAWA funding will be better equipped to align their work with
  practices that are known to be effective, and they will be more capable of generating
  empirical knowledge on the efficacy of new and promising ways of doing things. Because
  OVW has very limited funds to support research and evaluation, this program prioritizes
  topics for which a stronger evidence base would help OVW grantees use federal funds
  most effectively.
