objective: NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) leads the development,
  demonstration, and infusion of transformational space technologies that solve critical
  stakeholder needs. As the tech base for civil space, STMD advances technology to
  support future NASA, other government, and commercial missions. STMD investments
  aim to (1) advance U.S. space technology innovation and competitiveness in a global
  context, (2) encourage technology driven economic growth with an emphasis on the
  expanding space economy, and (3) inspire and develop a diverse and powerful U.S.
  aerospace technology community. STMD bolsters and funds diverse ideas from entrepreneurs,
  researchers, and innovators across the country. Space technology research and development
  occurs at NASA centers, universities, national labs, and small businesses.

- description: "1) The Deep Space Atomic Clock launched in late June 2019 aboard the\
    \ SpaceX Falcon Heavy as a rideshare with the U.S. Air Force's STP-2 mission.\
    \ This mission is demonstrating a small, low-mass atomic clock based on mercury-ion\
    \ trap technology, providing unprecedented stability needed for next-generation\
    \ deep space navigation and radio science. The atomic clock on this mission offers\
    \ the promise of 50 times greater accuracy than today’s best space navigation\
    \ clocks. \n\n\n\n\n\n2) NASA's Green Propellant Infusion Mission launched in\
    \ late June 2019 aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy as a rideshare with the U.S. Air\
    \ Force's STP-2 mission. The mission is demonstrating a propulsion system using\
    \ a significantly less toxic propellant than hydrazine while providing 40 percent\
    \ higher performance by volume. \n\n3) The CubeSat Handling of Multisystem Precision\
    \ Time Transfer mission launched via Rocket Lab in December 2018 to demonstrate\
    \ a precision timing satellite equipped with atomic clocks synchronized with a\
    \ ground clock through laser pulse. \n\n4) Flight Opportunities flew 43 technology\
    \ development payloads across four suborbital launch vehicle flights, one vertical\
    \ takeoff/lander flight, six high-altitude balloon flights, and one parabolic\
    \ campaign."
