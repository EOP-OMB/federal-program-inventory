objective: NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) aims to transform future
  missions while ensuring American leadership in aerospace. As NASA embarks on the
  next era of space exploration with Artemis, STMD is advancing technologies and testing
  new capabilities at the Moon. Many of the same systems will prove critical at Mars.
  STMD’s portfolio spans a range of discipline areas and technology readiness levels.  STMD
  bolsters and funds diverse ideas from entrepreneurs, researchers, and innovators
  across the country. Space technology research and development occurs at NASA centers,
  universities, national labs, and small businesses. STMD leverages partnerships with
  other government agencies and commercial partners to quickly advance and demonstrate
  cross-cutting capabilities. Investments in revolutionary, American-made space technologies
  provide solutions on Earth and in space. We make our innovations available to commercial
  companies to generate real-world benefits – everything from creating jobs to saving
  lives.

- description: "1) The Deep Space Atomic Clock launched in late June 2019 aboard the\
    \ SpaceX Falcon Heavy as a rideshare with the U.S. Air Force's STP-2 mission.\
    \ This mission is demonstrating a small, low-mass atomic clock based on mercury-ion\
    \ trap technology, providing unprecedented stability needed for next-generation\
    \ deep space navigation and radio science. The atomic clock on this mission offers\
    \ the promise of 50 times greater accuracy than today’s best space navigation\
    \ clocks. \n\n\n\n\n\n2) NASA's Green Propellant Infusion Mission launched in\
    \ late June 2019 aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy as a rideshare with the U.S. Air\
    \ Force's STP-2 mission. The mission is demonstrating a propulsion system using\
    \ a significantly less toxic propellant than hydrazine while providing 40 percent\
    \ higher performance by volume. \n\n3) The CubeSat Handling of Multisystem Precision\
    \ Time Transfer mission launched via Rocket Lab in December 2018 to demonstrate\
    \ a precision timing satellite equipped with atomic clocks synchronized with a\
    \ ground clock through laser pulse. \n\n4) Flight Opportunities flew 43 technology\
    \ development payloads across four suborbital launch vehicle flights, one vertical\
    \ takeoff/lander flight, six high-altitude balloon flights, and one parabolic\
    \ campaign."
