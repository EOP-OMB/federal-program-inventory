objective: 'The objectives of the competitive grant programs under this Assistance
  Listing are broad but are all generally intended to provide funding to document
  and preserve cultural resources that are important to American history. Following
  Congressional guidance, specific grant programs emphasize social, cultural, or historic
  themes and target funding to historic events like the struggle for civil and equal
  rights in the United States, documenting and preserving the stories of underrepresented
  communities, or preserving sites associated with the founding of the nation.

  Examples of grant programs could include: African American Civil Rights, Paul Bruhn
  Historic Revitalization, History of Equal Rights, Semiquincentennial, Underrepresented
  Communities, Tribal Heritage, and future competitive grant programs as may be created
  by Congress'
