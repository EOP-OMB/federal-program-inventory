objective: A credit is provided for crude oil and natural gas produced from a qualified
  marginal well. A marginal well is one that does not produce more than 1,095 barrel-of-oil
  equivalents per year, with this limit adjusted proportionately for the number of
  days the well is in production in a given year. The credit is no more than $3.00
  per barrel of qualified crude oil production and $0.50 per thousand cubic feet of
  qualified natural gas production. The credit for natural gas is reduced in proportion
  to the amount by which the reference price of natural gas at the wellhead for the
  previous calendar year exceeds $1.67 per thousand cubic feet and is zero for a reference
  price that exceeds $2.00. The credit for crude oil is reduced in proportion to the
  amount by which the reference price of oil for the previous calendar year exceeds
  $15.00 per barrel and is zero for a reference price that exceeds $18.00. All dollar
  amounts are adjusted for inflation from 2004.
