    conducted by AT programs. Over 54,000 AT devices were loaned on a short-term basis
    through Device Loan Programs. Close to 80,000 AT devices were re-utilized, saving
    consumers $31,000,000 by obtaining a gently used or refurbished AT device rather
    than a new one. 88 percent of recipients of State Financing-indicated an AT device
    could not be obtained without the assistance of the state financing activity. '
