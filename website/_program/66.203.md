objective: 'The Environmental Finance Center Grant Program provides funding to support
  Regional and National Environmental Finance Centers (EFCs) in the following categories:
  1) Regional Multi-Environmental Media EFCs, 2) Regional Water Infrastructure EFCs
  with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) appropriations, and 3) National
  Water Infrastructure EFCs with IIJA Funding. The EFCs work with state and tribal
  governments, local governments, and the private sector to address the growing costs
  of environmental protection. The EFCs provide finance-related training, education,
  and analytical studies to help these regulated parties develop solutions to the
  difficult "how-to-pay" issues associated with meeting environmental standards. The
  EFCs educate state, tribal, and local governments and businesses on lowering environmental
  costs, increasing environmental investments, improving financial capacity, identifying
  appropriate revenue generating mechanisms, and evaluating environmental financing
  options. A central goal of the EFCs is to create sustainable systems. Sustainable
  systems have the financial, technical, and institutional resources and capabilities
  to operate in compliance with environmental requirements and in conformance with
  accepted environmental practices over the long term. EFCs focus on helping smaller
  parties find ways to obtain financing for their environmental protection responsibilities.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: Providing education, training, technical assistance,
  and analytic support and outreach to state, tribal and local governments and businesses
  (with a focus on smaller governments and businesses) on: (1) supporting cleaner/greener
  business through source reduction, pollution prevention, conservation, resource
  recovery, reuse, and recycling (sustainable materials management); (2) promoting
  environmentally sustainable development, redevelopment, smart growth and land use
  planning; green infrastructure approaches; and green building efforts by state and
  local governments and the private sector; (3) supporting wetlands programs and protection;
  (4) improving drinking water and wastewater utility water conservation, energy efficiency,
  management, and capital planning; (5) encouraging green jobs and green business
  products and services; (6) promoting innovative ways to finance and otherwise support
  interstate, state, regional, and local air pollution reduction efforts; (7) assisting
  the owners and operators of small, medium, and disadvantaged environmental systems
  in planning, developing, and obtaining financing for infrastructure projects; (8)
  developing fiscal sustainability plans for utilities that include inventories of
  critical assets, evaluations asset performance, energy conservation efforts, operations,
  maintenance and repair needs and activities, and any required certifications; (9)
  reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and developing decision tools and financial strategies
  for adaptation to adverse weather events and/or climate change.; (10) identifying,
  supporting and advancing environmental equity and justice concerns, where appropriate,
  in all training, outreach, projects, programs, and activities; and, (11) encouraging
  the development and use of public-private partnerships, where appropriate in providing
  environmental services, infrastructure, projects, and activities.'

- description: 'In FY 2016, EPA anticipates awarding nine university-based Environmental
    Finance Centers (EFCs) to work with state, tribal, and local governments and the
    private sector to develop and implement a wide range of creative, responsible,
    and sustainable solutions to existing and new environmental challenges. Each participating
    university will operate an EFC or EFCs that will provide technical assistance
    and outreach services to the regulated communities (States, tribal, local governments
    and businesses). The EFCs will provide finance-related training, education, and
    analytical studies to help these regulated parties develop solutions to the difficult
    "how-to-pay" issues associated with meeting environmental standards. The EFCs
    will educate state, tribal, and local governments and businesses on lowering environmental
    costs, increasing environmental investments, improving financial capacity, encouraging
    full cost pricing, and identifying and evaluating environmental financing options.
    n FY 2016, nine (eight university-base and one nonprofit-based) Environmental
    Finance Centers (EFCs) worked with state, tribal, and local governments as well
    as the private sector in developing and implementing a range of creative, responsible,
    and sustainable solutions to existing and new environmental challenges. In this
    first year of the new EFC grant award period, five of the eight grantees operating
    EFCs under the previous grant award were awarded funding and four new grantees
    were awarded funding and began operating as EFCs. EFC accomplishments in FY 2016
    included: (1) University of Southern Maine EFC - (1) facilitating a series of
    three workshops on implementing a stormwater financing program in the Narragansett
    Bay that presented the components of a good stormwater feasibility study, examined
    ways to gain community acceptance and build political support, looked at options
    for reducing costs and leveraging innovative financing, and shared ways to build
    successful partnerships; (2) Syracuse University EFC - building stakeholder partnerships
    in New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico to strengthen and develop regional marine
    debris protection (trash free waters) and providing climate resiliency training
    on issues including watershed management, strengthening infrastructure for flood
    protection, financing resiliency, and storm water asset management planning; (3)
    University of Maryland EFC â€“ implementing and expanding the Sustainable Maryland
    Certified program that helps Maryland municipalities to find cost-effective and
    strategic ways to protect their natural assets and revitalize their communities,
    and developing a Municipal Online Stormwater Training (MOST) Center that provides
    communities with access to needed storm water management technical and financial
    resources through a comprehensive and interactive online training program; (4)
    University of North Carolina EFC - comparing the financial structures and outcomes
    of alternative water service delivery models (including public-private partnerships)
    in nine communities across the country, and assisting EPA WaterCARE communities
    in developing sustainable financing strategies to address the challenges of aging
    water infrastructure; (5) Michigan Technological University EFC - staffing and
    standing up a new center that will focus on providing financial technical assistance
    on water, wastewater, and storm water infrastructure issues especially for small
    and rural communities; (6) University of New Mexico EFC - delivering technical,
    managerial, and financial capacity building training for small water systems covering
    important topics such as water loss control, asset management, and operator certifications
    and providing needed financial planning support to EPA WaterCARE communities;
    (7) Wichita State University EFC - performing energy assessments for small to
    medium sized wastewater treatment plants across the state of Kansas identifying
    substantial energy reduction opportunities and significant cost savings, and implementing
    an educational and training program designed to stimulate the interest of high
    school students in the career opportunities in the water and wastewater industry;
    (8) California State University at Sacramento (Sacramento State) - staffing and
    standing up a new EFC that looks to provide cost-effective solutions to protecting
    public health and the environment focusing on stormwater management, sustainable
    utility operations, solid and hazardous waste management and tribal communities;
    and (9) Rural Community Assistance Corporation - Standing up a new EFC that will
    focus on providing infrastructure financial education to tribal communities, creating
    map-based tools for asset management, and developing financial analysis that incorporates
    cultural concerns when comparing adapt-in-place costs to relocation costs for
    infrastructure.'
