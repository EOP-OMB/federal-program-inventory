objective: 'The Environmental Finance Center Grant Program provides funding to support
  Regional and National Environmental Finance Centers (EFCs) in the following categories:
  1) Regional Multi-Environmental Media EFCs, 2) Regional Water Infrastructure EFCs
  with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) appropriations, and 3) National
  Water Infrastructure EFCs with IIJA Funding. The EFCs work with state and tribal
  governments, local governments, and the private sector to address the growing costs
  of environmental protection. The EFCs provide finance-related training, education,
  and analytical studies to help these regulated parties develop solutions to the
  difficult "how-to-pay" issues associated with meeting environmental standards. The
  EFCs educate state, tribal, and local governments and businesses on lowering environmental
  costs, increasing environmental investments, improving financial capacity, identifying
  appropriate revenue generating mechanisms, and evaluating environmental financing
  options. A central goal of the EFCs is to create sustainable systems. Sustainable
  systems have the financial, technical, and institutional resources and capabilities
  to operate in compliance with environmental requirements and in conformance with
  accepted environmental practices over the long term. EFCs focus on helping smaller
  parties find ways to obtain financing for their environmental protection responsibilities.
