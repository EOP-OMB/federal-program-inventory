  \ implement SORNA. Additionally, assist criminal justice professionals across the\
  \ entire spectrum of sex offender management activities needed to prevent sexual\
  \ violence and ensure public safety. SORNA also sets forth requirements for sex\
  \ offender registries to participate in NSOPW. NSOPW links to state, territory and\
  \ tribal public sex offender registries allowing nationwide searches for registered\
  \ sex offenders, and provides numerous additional technical tools and resources.\n\
