objective: "Goals: To assist states, the District of Columbia, principal U.S. territories,\
  \ and Tribes with developing and/or enhancing programs designed to implement requirements\
  \ of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Title I of the\
  \ Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (AWA); to fund other grant\
  \ programs that support AWA; and to provide for the maintenance and operation of\
  \ the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW.gov). \n\nObjectives:\
  \ For jurisdictions that have substantially implemented SORNA, support continued\
  \ implementation, enhance registration programs, and address any SORNA requirements\
  \ that are not yet met. For jurisdictions that have not yet substantially implemented\
  \ SORNA, support the jurisdiction’s efforts to substantially implement SORNA. Additionally,\
  \ assist criminal justice professionals across the entire spectrum of sex offender\
  \ management activities needed to prevent sexual violence and ensure public safety.\
  \ SORNA also sets forth requirements for jurisdictions to participate in NSOPW.\
  \ NSOPW connects state, territory, and Tribal public sex offender registries allowing\
  \ nationwide searches for registered sex offenders and provides numerous additional\
  \ technical tools and educational resources.\n\nAWA:  Performance Measure 1: Number\
  \ of staff trained (if applicable). Performance Measure 2:  Number of records that\
  \ are automated (if applicable)\n\nNSOPW:  Performance Measure 1:  Number of inquiries\
  \ against NSOPW. Performance Measure 2:  Number of states (including D.C.), territories,\
  \ and tribes participating in NSOPW."

- description: "AWA: Prior to enactment of SORNA, there were inconsistencies among\
    \ state and territory registration and notification laws, programs and policies;\
    \ registration and notification were all but absent in Indian Country. These inconsistencies\
    \ created safe havens and allowed sex offenders to move between jurisdictions\
    \ without notice to law enforcement or the public. These challenges potentially\
    \ hindered law enforcement’s ability to detect and apprehend sex offenders and\
    \ reduced public awareness about sex offenders residing in communities. Consistent\
    \ registration and notification policies and programs are needed to ensure comprehensive\
    \ and timely information sharing between jurisdictions and with the public. \n\
    \nTo address these challenges, the SMART Office assists states, Tribes, and territories\
    \ in taking the steps needed to maintain sex offender registration and notification\
    \ programs that meet SORNA requirements, or to bring them closer to implementing\
    \ SORNA. SMART seeks to achieve this through direct funding provided by the Support\
    \ for Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program.\n\nNSOPW: The Dru Sjodin National\
    \ Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW) is a critical component of SORNA’s requirement\
    \ to provide a comprehensive national sex offender registration and notification\
    \ system to notify and protect the public from sex offenders. NSOPW allows law\
    \ enforcement and the public to search existing state, territory and tribal sex\
    \ offender registries for public sex offender data. With a single query from any\
    \ web capable computer, NSOPW searches state, territory and Tribal publicly available\
    \ sex offender registration information and delivers results based on name, zip\
    \ code, or geographic radius."
