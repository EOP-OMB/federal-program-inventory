objective: "Goals: To assist states, the District of Columbia, principal U.S. territories\
  \ and tribes with developing and/or enhancing programs designed to implement requirements\
  \ of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Title I of the\
  \ Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (AWA); to fund other grant\
  \ programs that support AWA; and to provide for the maintenance and operation of\

  \ For jurisdictions that have substantially implemented SORNA, support continued\
  \ implementation, enhance registration programs and address any SORNA requirements\
  \ that are not yet met. For jurisdictions that have not yet substantially implemented\
  \ SORNA, support the jurisdictionâ€™s efforts to address deficiencies to substantially\
  \ implement SORNA. Additionally, assist criminal justice professionals across the\
  \ entire spectrum of sex offender management activities needed to prevent sexual\
  \ violence and ensure public safety. SORNA also sets forth requirements for sex\
  \ offender registries to participate in NSOPW. NSOPW links to state, territory and\
  \ tribal public sex offender registries allowing nationwide searches for registered\
  \ sex offenders, and provides numerous additional technical tools and resources.\n\
  \nAWA Objective: To improve public sex offender registry systems to support and\
  \ maintain SORNA implementation.\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of staff trained\
  \ (if applicable). Performance Measure 2:  Number of records that are automated\

  \ of inquiries against NSOPW. Performance Measure 2:  Number of states (including\
