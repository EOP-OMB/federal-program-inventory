objective: "The purpose of the BRAG program Assistance Listing 10.219, is to support\
  \ the generation of new information that will assist Federal regulatory agencies\
  \ [USDA\u2019s \u2013 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - Biotechnology\
  \ Regulatory Services (APHIS-BRS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department\
  \ of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] in making\
  \ science-based decisions about the environmental effects of introducing genetically\
  \ engineered (GE) organisms by techniques that use recombinant, synthesized, or\
  \ amplified nucleic acids to modify or create a genome. The organisms include plants,\
  \ microorganisms (including fungi, bacteria, and viruses), arthropods, fish, birds,\
  \ livestock, and other animals these include related wild and agricultural organisms.\n\
  \nThe statutory program goals and objectives are to authorize and support environmental\
  \ \nassessment research to help identify and analyze environmental effects of biotechnology\
  \ and to \nauthorize research to help regulators develop long-term policies concerning\
  \ the introduction of \nsuch technology.\nThe BRAG program supports applied and/or\
  \ fundamental research relevant to environmental risk \nassessment, including biological\
  \ risk, and the Federal regulatory process. When evaluating GE \norganisms, Federal\
  \ regulators must answer the following four general questions:\n1. Is there a hazard?\
  \ (Potential hazard identification.) \n2. How likely is the hazard to occur? (Quantifying\
  \ the probability of occurrence; identifying \nlikely exposure scenarios.) \n3.\
  \ What is the severity and extent of the hazard if it occurs? (Quantifying the effects)\
  \ and\n4. Is there an effect beyond what might occur with an unmodified organism\
  \ or an organism \nthat has similar traits, but was developed using other technologies?"
