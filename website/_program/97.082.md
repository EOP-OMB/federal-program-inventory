objective: 'The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is the Federal
  Government’s coordinated approach to addressing earthquake risks. In support of
  NEHRP, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the Earthquake
  State Assistance grant program which is designed to increase and enhance the effective
  implementation of earthquake risk reduction activities at the national, regional,
  state and local level, by making funding available through annual, non-competitive
  and competitive grants. NEHRP implements the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
  and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD -8) objective of hazard mitigation, to develop
  and maintain those capabilities necessary to reduce the loss of lives and property
  by lessening the impact of earthquakes. In an effort to provide eligible States
  and Territories with multiple funding and project management options, as well as
  to allow for multi-state coordination of projects, the Earthquake State Assistance
  grant program utilizes two separate funding opportunities: Individual State Earthquake
  Assistance (ISEA), and Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance (MSNEA). The
  Individual State Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity provides funding directly
  to those States and Territories that have been determined to be at a high, or a
  very high risk of earthquakes, and who can provide the statutory 25 percent cost-share.
  They must also be able to demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced
  seismic safety in the State. Funding is provided to eligible States and Territories
  through non-competitive grants that are administered by FEMA Regional earthquake
  program management staff. Allowable activities include: Support of seismic mitigation
  planning, developing inventories and conducting seismic safety inspections of critical
  structures and lifeline infrastructure, updating building codes, zoning codes, and
  ordinances to enhance seismic safety, increasing earthquake awareness and education,
  participation in emergency management exercises that substantially benefit earthquake
  mitigation efforts, and the promotion of earthquake insurance. Additionally, the
  Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity is designed to
  facilitate the development and management of National, regional and multi-state
  earthquake risk reductions activities. Funding is made available through competitive
  grants to nonprofit organizations, as defined by 2 C.F.R. §200.70 and institutions
  of higher education as defined by 2 C.F.R. §200.55. The grants are administered
  by FEMA Headquarters’ earthquake program management staff.'

    \ facilities, earthquake ShakeOut drills, National Earthquake Conference (occurs\
    \ every 4 years), education and outreach presentations to schools, businesses,\
    \ governments at all levels. Performed building inventory and rapid visual screenings\
    \ for potential seismic hazards of two school districts in Missouri, including\
    \ more than 31 school buildings.  Coordinated screenings for two school districts\
    \ in Missouri comprising 11 additional buildings; Great Central U.S. and Great\
    \ SouthEeast ShakeOut Earthquake Drill on October 15, 2015.  ShakeOut Earthquake\
    \ Drills involve earthquake safety, mitigation, and planning activities as part\
    \ of a national and worldwide initiative. The drills took place in 21 states and\
    \ the District of Columbia, with more than 5.5 Million people participating in\
    \ the event.  Activities included a coordinated outreach and media campaign including\
    \ presentations, press releases, social media, newsletter, and billboard advertisement;\
    \ Conducted Visual assessment of critical infrastructure in Wyoming state. The\
    \ goal of the assessment is to pursue future mitigation actions to minimize the\
    \ impact of an earthquake on critical infrastructure, particularly hospitals,\
    \ schools, previously-identified shelter locations, and locations housing ambulance,\
    \ fire and law enforcement response vehicles; Finalized plans for 2017 Arkansas\
    \ Post-Disaster Building Inspection (INSPARK) regional training/workshop. Participants\
    \ include building inspection teams from surrounding CUSEC states as well as observers\
    \ from Oklahoma, FEMA and Mississippi; State of Nevada conducted URM verification\
    \ in Clark County. The project allowed Clark County Department of Building and\
    \ Fire Prevention to partner with the NEHRP funding through EERI (NEHRP was small\
    \ part of the overall total cost of the project) in order to go out and do a verification\
    \ of our initial rough list of URM buildings in unincorporated Clark County. \
    \ The project was done by manual process.  This information is available to both\
    \ the State as well as Clark County in the updates of their hazard mitigation\
    \ plans. \r\n"
