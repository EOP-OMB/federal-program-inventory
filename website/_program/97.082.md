objective: "The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is the Federal\
  \ Government\u2019s coordinated approach to addressing earthquake risks. In support\
  \ of NEHRP, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the Earthquake\
  \ State Assistance grant program which is designed to increase and enhance the effective\
  \ implementation of earthquake risk reduction activities at the national, regional,\
  \ state and local level, by making funding available through annual, non-competitive\
  \ and competitive grants. NEHRP implements the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\
  \ and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD -8) objective of hazard mitigation, to\
  \ develop and maintain those capabilities necessary to reduce the loss of lives\
  \ and property by lessening the impact of earthquakes. In an effort to provide eligible\
  \ States and Territories with multiple funding and project management options, as\
  \ well as to allow for multi-state coordination of projects, the Earthquake State\
  \ Assistance grant program utilizes two separate funding opportunities: Individual\
  \ State Earthquake Assistance (ISEA), and Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance\
  \ (MSNEA). The Individual State Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity provides\
  \ funding directly to those States and Territories that have been determined to\
  \ be at a high, or a very high risk of earthquakes, and who can provide the statutory\
  \ 25 percent cost-share. They must also be able to demonstrate that the assistance\
  \ will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State. Funding is provided to eligible\
  \ States and Territories through non-competitive grants that are administered by\
  \ FEMA Regional earthquake program management staff. Allowable activities include:\
  \ Support of seismic mitigation planning, developing inventories and conducting\
  \ seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifeline infrastructure,\
  \ updating building codes, zoning codes, and ordinances to enhance seismic safety,\
  \ increasing earthquake awareness and education, participation in emergency management\
  \ exercises that substantially benefit earthquake mitigation efforts, and the promotion\
  \ of earthquake insurance. Additionally, the Multi-State and National Earthquake\
  \ Assistance funding opportunity is designed to facilitate the development and management\
  \ of National, regional and multi-state earthquake risk reductions activities. Funding\
  \ is made available through competitive grants to nonprofit organizations, as defined\
  \ by 2 C.F.R. \xA7200.70 and institutions of higher education as defined by 2 C.F.R.\
  \ \xA7200.55. The grants are administered by FEMA Headquarters\u2019 earthquake\
  \ program management staff."
