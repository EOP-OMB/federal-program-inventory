results:
- description: Several FY16 activities continued, along with a focus on regional and
    topical working groups to address various needs and issues at the regional, state
    and local levels.  Work continued on data access, educational efforts integrating
    remote sensing into more K-18 curricula and determining local communities’ remote
    sensing requirements to address timely issues such as water quantity and quality,
    hazard mitigation, and resource management.  Projects will continue in this final
    grant period estimated to be a 6-month period of performance.
  year: '2017'
- description: Year 1 of the current grant activity established initial projects at
    the State level of a multi-state remote sensing education, outreach and research
    grant activity along with overarching consortium activities such as annual meetings
    and reporting requirements.  Focus included regional and topical working groups
    to address various needs and issues at the regional, state and local levels.  Projects
    were initiated on data access and training, educational efforts integrating remote
    sensing into more K-18 curricula and determining local communities' remote sensing
    requirements to address timely issues such as water quantity and quality, hazard
    mitigation, and resource management.  For each Fiscal Year, award is granted to
    the nationwide consortium, including sub-tier awards to 39 states with oversight
    by designated state-level PIs or Coordinators.  For FY18, approximately 94 projects
    and activities were scheduled throughout the 39 state consortiums.  Projects at
    the State level are planned to continue in follow-on, optional years of this grant,
    subject to management approval and availability of funds.

    grant activity along with overarching consortium activities such as annual meetings
    and reporting requirements.  Focus included regional and topical working groups
    to address various needs and issues at the regional, state and local levels.  Projects
    focused on data access and training, educational efforts integrating remote sensing
    into more K-18 curricula and determining local communities' remote sensing requirements
    to address timely issues such as water quantity and quality, hazard mitigation,
    and resource management.  For each Fiscal Year, award is granted to the nationwide
    consortium, including sub-tier awards to 38 states with oversight by designated
    state-level PIs or Coordinators.  Projects at the State level are planned to continue
    in follow-on, optional years of this grant, subject to Program management approval
    and availability of funds.
