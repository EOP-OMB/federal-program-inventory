objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers
  with a tax credit for qualified wages paid to individuals. The credit applies to
  employees who began work on or before December 31, 2025 and who are certified as
  members of various targeted groups. The amount of the credit that can be claimed
  is 25 percent of qualified wages for employment less than 400 hours and 40 percent
  for employment of 400 hours or more. Generally, the maximum credit per employee
  is $2,400 and can only be claimed on the first year of wages an individual earns
  from an employer. However, the credit for long-term welfare recipients can be claimed
  on second year wages as well and has a $9,000 maximum. Also, certain categories
  of veterans are eligible for a higher maximum credit of up to $9,600. Employers
  must reduce their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed.
