objective: "Goal(s): The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program\
  \ (the Coverdell Program) awards grants to states and units of local government\
  \ to help improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner/coroner\
  \ services. (Proposed, from BJA website) \n\nObjective(s): The objectives of the\
  \ Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Program are to: 1. Carry out all or\
  \ a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness\
  \ of forensic science or medical examiner/coroner’s office services, including those\
  \ services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by\
  \ units of local government within the state; 2. Eliminate a backlog in the analysis\
  \ of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect\
  \ to firearms examination, latent prints, impression evidence, toxicology, digital\
  \ evidence, fire evidence, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned\
  \ documents, and trace evidence; 3. Train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory\
  \ personnel and medicolegal death investigators, as needed to eliminate such a backlog;\
  \ 4. Address emerging forensic science issues (such as statistics, contextual bias,\
  \ and uncertainty of measurement) and emerging forensic science technology (such\
  \ as high throughput automation, statistical software, and new types of instrumentation);\
  \ 5. Educate and train forensic pathologists; and 6. Fund medicolegal death investigation\
  \ systems to facilitate accreditation of medical examiner and coroner offices and\
  \ certification of medicolegal death investigators.\nPerformance Measure 1: Number\
  \ of backlogged cases analyzed with Coverdell funds; and,  \n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 2:  Number of forensics and medical examiner personnel trained."
