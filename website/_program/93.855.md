objective: To assist public and private nonprofit institutions and individuals to
  establish, expand and improve biomedical research and research training in infectious
  diseases and related areas; to conduct developmental research, to produce and test
  research materials.  To assist public, private and commercial institutions to conduct
  developmental research, to produce and test research materials, to provide research
  services as required by the agency for programs in infectious diseases, and controlling
  disease caused by infectious or parasitic agents, allergic and immunologic diseases
  and related areas.   Projects range from studies of microbial physiology and antigenic
  structure to collaborative trials of experimental drugs and vaccines, mechanisms
  of resistance to antibiotics as well as research dealing with epidemiological observations
  in hospitalized patients or community populations and progress in allergic and immunologic
  diseases.  Because of this dual focus, the program encompasses both basic research
  and clinical research.  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program expands
  and improves private sector participation in biomedical research.  The SBIR Program
  intends to increase and facilitate private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation.  The Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) program stimulates and fosters scientific and technological innovation
  through cooperative research and development carried out between small business
  concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.   Research
  Career Development Awards support the development of scientists during the formative
  stages of their careers.   Individual National Research Service Awards (NRSAs) are
  made directly to approve applicants for research training in specified biomedical
  shortage areas.  In addition, Institutional National Research Service Awards are
  made to enable institutions to select and make awards to individuals to receive
  training under the aegis of their institutional program.
