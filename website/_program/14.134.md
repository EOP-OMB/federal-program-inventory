objective: HUD insures mortgage loans to finance the construction or rehabilitation
  of a broad range of multifamily rental housing through a variety of programs linked
  in the Related Federal Assistance section. Though Section 207 itself is no longer
  active, this assistance listing is used to provide total FHA multifamily mortgage
  commitments across those programs. Due to challenges in breaking out projected commitments
  by each listing, the activity is summed and reported here.
