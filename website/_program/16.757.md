    \ improve the experiences of the children and families they serve, as well as\
    \ to assist courts in reducing the secondary trauma that professionals who work\
    \ in this field often experience. To date, NCJFCJ has conducted more than 35 trauma\
    \ consultations in state and tribal jurisdictions, providing feedback on how they\
    \ can become more trauma-responsive.\n\n•\tNCJFCJ has held nine National Judicial\
    \ Institutes on Domestic Child Sex Trafficking with over 200 judicial officials\
    \ trained. The two and half day trainings are led by a faculty team of experienced\
    \ judges and other experts from across the country and provide judicial officials\
    \ an opportunity to expand their knowledge of trafficking risk factors, victim\
    \ identification, effective intervention strategies, and cultural considerations.\
    \  Additional Institutes will occur throughout 2019."
