objective: ERP provides financial assistance to producers for losses to crops, trees,
  bushes, and vines due to wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat,
  winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture,
  qualifying drought, and related conditions occurring in calendar years 2020 and
  2021. Losses due to drought are only eligible for assistance if any area within
  the county in which the loss occurred was rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having
  a D2 (severe drought) for eight consecutive weeks or a D3 (extreme drought) or higher
  level of drought intensity for any period of time during the calendar year. This
  program is authorized by the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency
  Assistance Act (Pub. L. 117-43). ERP will be administered in two phases. Phase 1
  uses a streamlined process with pre-filled application forms when the data needed
  to calculate a payment is already on file with FSA or USDA’s Risk Management Agency
  (RMA) as a result of the producer previously receiving a crop insurance indemnity
  under certain crop insurance policies or a payment through FSA’s Noninsured Crop
  Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). Phase 2 uses a producer’s decrease in allowable
  gross revenue as an approximation of a producer’s crop losses due to qualifying
  disaster events, which reflects losses in both production and quality and captures
  a producer’s loss regardless of whether the loss occurs before harvest or after
  harvest while the crop is in storage, further streamlining the delivery of assistance.
