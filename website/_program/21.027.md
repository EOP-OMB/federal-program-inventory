  2021) authorizes the Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund (CSFRF) and Coronavirus

  in total funding to Treasury to make payments generally to States (defined to include
  the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories (defined to include, Puerto Rico, U.S.
  Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), Indian Tribes,
  Metropolitan cities, Counties, and Nonentitlement units of local government to respond
  to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative economic impact, including
  to provide assistance to households, small business, nonprofits, and impacted industries,
  such as tourism, travel, and hospitality; respond to workers performing essential

  the State, territory, Tribal government, metropolitan city, county, or nonentitlement
  units of local government performing essential work or by providing grants to eligible
  employers that have eligible workers; provide government services, to the extent
