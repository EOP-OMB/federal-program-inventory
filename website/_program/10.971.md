objective: Assistance from USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) to selected eligible applicants
  to conduct targeted outreach and technical assistance on FSA programs in urban areas,
  with an emphasis on communities of disadvantaged, historically-underserved, beginning,
  and veteran socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in urban areas. Socially
  disadvantaged groups are defined as a group whose members have been subjected to
  racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice because of their identity as members of a group
  without regard to their individual qualities. Outreach and technical assistance
  are focused on educating agricultural producers in one or more of FSA’s Urban County
  Committee (COC) Pilot locations and other urban areas. These agreements will support
  urban agriculture outreach, research, training, technical assistance, and education
  projects through non-competitive cooperative agreements with local organizations.
  Micro-grants may be authorized to urban agricultural producers as beneficiaries
  as needed for projects that support the goals of this opportunity and for areas
  where USDA funding already isn’t available. FSA must approve the project plan before
  the micro-grant portion of any proposal could be implemented. With the complex nature
  of some of FSA’s programs, FSA will focus additional outreach and education to producers
  in areas who could benefit from additional outreach in order to  (1) increase knowledge,
  awareness, and participation in FSA and USDA programs and services associated with
  growing food in an urban area; (2) assist farmers with expanding their farming operations,
  accessing land, and implementing climate-friendly practices that can mitigate their
  susceptibility to natural disasters in urban areas; and (3) increase representation
  of underserved farmers serving on Urban County Committees.
