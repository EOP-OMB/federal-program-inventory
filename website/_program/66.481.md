objective: 'The goal of this program is to implement the Lake Champlain Basin Management
  Plan, Opportunities for Action: An Evolving Plan for the Future of the Lake Champlain
  Basin 2022 (Opportunities for Action), and to assist the states of New York and
  Vermont in protecting, restoring and preserving the water quality and ecological
  health of the Lake Champlain ecosystem. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Efforts
  in Lake Champlain will continue to support the successful interstate, interagency,
  and international partnership undertaking the implementation of Opportunities for
  Action, a plan designed to protect and where necessary restore the lake''s water
  quality, sustain healthy ecosystems in the basin, support thriving communities and
  inform and involve the public in lake issues and activities. Financial awards under
  this program are made to the States of Vermont and New York, and to the New England
  Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC) to implement Opportunities
  for Action. Congress directed EPA to allocate $25,000,000 for the Lake Champlain
  program via the Appropriations Act of 2023. These funds shall be allocated through
  the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP), other than $8,000,000, which shall be directed
  to support significant, impactful projects identified in the 52 state implementation
  plan that will make measurable progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction
  targets of the EPA''s 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain.
  Funding priorities include phosphorus reduction, cyanobacteria control, water quality
  monitoring to track progress and alerts to the public if unsafe conditions exist,
  implementation of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program as
  authorized by the Vessel Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115–282), aquatic invasive
  species prevention and control, habitat protection and restoration, and environmental
  education and outreach. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA),
  the LCBP received $8 million for FY23 through CWA Section 120. These allocations
  are expected to continue for five years through FY26. The Lake Champlain priorities
  for funding include increased technical assistance, capacity, and implementation
  funding to support aquatic organism passage, floodplain restoration and flood mitigation,
  use of natural infrastructure, and habitat restoration and conservation programs
  that have the potential to support traditionally underserved communities and/or
  will mitigate the impacts of climate change. IIJA funding will also be prioritized
  to support significant, impactful projects identified in the state implementation
  plan that will make measurable progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction
  targets of the EPA’s 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain,
  and to implement the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program as
  authorized by the Vessel Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115–282) to address
  invasive species in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.'
