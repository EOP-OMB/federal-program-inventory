objective: "The goal of this program is to implement the Lake Champlain Basin Management\
  \ Plan, Opportunities for Action: An Evolving Plan for the Future of the Lake Champlain\
  \ Basin 2022 (Opportunities for Action), and to assist the states of New York and\
  \ Vermont in protecting, restoring and preserving the water quality and ecological\
  \ health of the Lake Champlain ecosystem. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:\
  \ Efforts in Lake Champlain will continue to support the successful interstate,\
  \ interagency, and international partnership undertaking the implementation of Opportunities\
  \ for Action, a plan designed to protect and where necessary restore the lake's\
  \ water quality, sustain healthy ecosystems in the basin, support thriving communities\
  \ and inform and involve the public in lake issues and activities. Financial awards\
  \ under this program are made to the States of Vermont and New York, and to the\
  \ New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC) to implement\
  \ Opportunities for Action. Congress directed EPA to allocate $25,000,000 for the\
  \ Lake Champlain program via the Appropriations Act of 2023. These funds shall be\
  \ allocated through the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP), other than $8,000,000,\
  \ which shall be directed to support significant, impactful projects identified\
  \ in the 52 state implementation plan that will make measurable progress towards\
  \ meeting the phosphorus reduction targets of the EPA's 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum\
  \ Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain. Funding priorities include phosphorus reduction,\
  \ cyanobacteria control, water quality monitoring to track progress and alerts to\
  \ the public if unsafe conditions exist, implementation of the Great Lakes and Lake\
  \ Champlain Invasive Species Program as authorized by the Vessel Incident Discharge\
  \ Act (Public Law 115\u2013282), aquatic invasive species prevention and control,\
  \ habitat protection and restoration, and environmental education and outreach.\
  \ Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the LCBP received $8\
  \ million for FY23 through CWA Section 120. These allocations are expected to continue\
  \ for five years through FY26. The Lake Champlain priorities for funding include\
  \ increased technical assistance, capacity, and implementation funding to support\
  \ aquatic organism passage, floodplain restoration and flood mitigation, use of\
  \ natural infrastructure, and habitat restoration and conservation programs that\
  \ have the potential to support traditionally underserved communities and/or will\
  \ mitigate the impacts of climate change. IIJA funding will also be prioritized\
  \ to support significant, impactful projects identified in the state implementation\
  \ plan that will make measurable progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction\
  \ targets of the EPA\u2019s 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for Lake\
  \ Champlain, and to implement the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species\
  \ Program as authorized by the Vessel Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115\u2013\
  282) to address invasive species in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain."
