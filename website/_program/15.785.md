objective: The town of Nicodemus, in Kansas, has national significance as the only
  remaining western town established by African-Americans during the Reconstruction
  period following the Civil War. The town of Nicodemus is symbolic of the pioneer
  spirit of African-Americans who dared to leave the only region they had been familiar
  with to seek personal freedom and the opportunity to develop their talents and capabilities.
  The purposes of this program is to preserve, protect, and interpret for the benefit
  and enjoyment of present and future generations, the remaining structures and locations
  that represent the history (including the settlement and growth) of the town of
  Nicodemus, Kansas; and (B) to interpret the historical role of the town of Nicodemus
  in the Reconstruction period in the context of the experience of westward expansion
  in the United States.
