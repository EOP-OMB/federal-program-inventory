objective: "The town of Nicodemus, in Kansas, has national significance as the only\
  \ remaining western town established by African-Americans during the Reconstruction\
  \ period following the Civil War. The town of Nicodemus is symbolic of the pioneer\
  \ spirit of African-Americans who dared to leave the only region they had been familiar\
  \ with to seek personal freedom and the opportunity to develop their talents and\
  \ capabilities. \n\n\nThe purposes of this program is to preserve, protect, and\
  \ interpret for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations, the\
  \ remaining structures and locations that represent the history (including the settlement\
  \ and growth) of the town of Nicodemus, Kansas; and to interpret the historical\
  \ role of the town of Nicodemus in the Reconstruction period in the context of the\
  \ experience of westward expansion in the United States."
