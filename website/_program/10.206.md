objective: To support research, education and extension grants that address key problems
  of national, regional and multistate importance in sustaining all components of
  agriculture (farming, ranching, forestry, aquaculture, rural communities, human
  nutrition and obesity, food and fiber processing, etc.) Providing this support to
  US agriculture requires that the NRI advance fundamental. Building on these discoveries
  will necessitate new efforts in education and extension that deliver science-based
  knowledge to people, allowing them to make informed practical decisions. All grants
  were awarded on a competitive basis.
