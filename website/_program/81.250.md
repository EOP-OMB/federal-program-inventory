objective: "The objective to fund analytical studies that characterize and examine\
  \ the potential of an integrated strategy for a multi-state region to enhance and\
  \ accelerate energy innovation via a regional energy innovation ecosystem.  For\
  \ purposes of these studies, a region must comprise a minimum of three contiguous\
  \ states.   The studies and supporting analysis should provide new insights as to\
  \ how an integrated regional strategy could promote affordable, reliable innovative\
  \ energy technology; create jobs; increase entrepreneurial activity and new venture\
  \ financing; and promote economic growth and prosperity. The studies should provide\
  \ data-driven insights and analysis, relying, in part, on inputs from current and\
  \ potential energy innovation ecosystem participants within the proposed region.\
  \ Studies should analytically support components of an integrated regional strategy\
  \ that could provide benefits that a \u201Cbusiness as usual\u201D approach would\
  \ not.  In addition to identifying how an integrated regional strategy might enhance\
  \ and accelerate energy technology and deployment, the results should help DOE identify\
  \ the possible benefits such regional innovation strategies might have to help meet\
  \ key national objectives of energy security, economic competitiveness and environmental\
  \ responsibility."
