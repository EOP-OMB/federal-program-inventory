layout: program
objective: The objective is to develop decision-relevant data and analysis on the
  market viability and program readiness (including availability, technological feasibility,
  incremental benefits, regulatory treatment, and cost-effectiveness) of potential
  consensus specification requirements for incentive-eligible equipment, and support
  deployment and in-field efficiency of qualifying equipment as part of utility ratepayer-funded
  energy efficiency programs. Recipient tasks include technical and market analysis
  to inform decisions on updating Energy Efficiency Product Performance Tiers, coordinate
  market transformation efforts to support the uptake and in-field performance of
  IRA Tax Credit-eligible residential equipment in the home retrofit market, and coordinate
  market transformation efforts to support the uptake and in-field performance of
  IRA Tax Credit-eligible residential equipment in targeted product-only programs
  and their controls in the “emergency” or “end of useful life" home equipment replacement
  market.

    \ Joint Roundtable at Energy Policy Outlook Conference to discuss electricity\
    \ policy. Launched Answers to State Questions (ASQ), an online forum for state\
    \ officials to submit questions that arise as a result of the EPA’s Clean Power\
    \ Plan. 3N Meeting conducted to discuss barriers and options under the EPA’s Clean\
    \ Power Plan Rule. NASEO EPIC staff briefed NASEO’s state energy planning lead\
    \ on the outcomes of the EPIC roundtable, white paper, and continued engagement\
    \ on the Quadrennial Energy Review. During this discussion, NASEO colleagues discussed\
    \ potential updates to NASEO’s statewide energy planning database to reflect policy\
    \ items raised over the course of the EPIC project.\r\n\r\nNGA: The NGA Center\
    \ continued to conduct research and update its database on state actions (i.e.,\
    \ legislation, executive orders, and regulations).  During this period, NGA Center\
    \ staff continued to track actions across seven policy categories including energy\
    \ efficiency, clean electricity and others. This included an update for 2015.\
    \ NGA Center staff also developed ideas for expanding the categories included\
    \ in the database.\r\nNGA Completed the policy database with state actions from\
    \ 2008 - 2015. They continue to work on the state actions for 2016. NGA has submitted\
    \ their top trends briefing to DOE.\r\nNGA hosted a webinar on State Energy Policy\

- description: "NASEO: Under task 3, NASEO hosted a webinar on Energy Workforce Development\
    \ for NASEO members and key partners, including 18 State Energy Office registrants.\r\
    \nUnder task 3, NASEO provided written briefing to EPSA on importance of energy\
    \ workforce development to advancing State Energy Office energy policy goals and\
    \ priorities. They also developed expanded workforce-­focused workplan for EPSA\
    \ consideration.\r\nUnder task 4, NASEO organized a small group conference call\
    \ with seven states to discuss data, metrics, and impact tracking associated with\
    \ comprehensive state energy planning.\r\n\r\nNGA: NGA researched a wide array\
    \ of sources and assessed the major policy and regulatory developments in all\
    \ states in the target areas. \r\n\r\nNCSL: Under task 1.1, NCSL has drafted outlines\
    \ of the two Energy Water Nexus papers, one on thermoelectric cooling and one\
    \ on lifecycle water responsibility in oil and gas production. NCSL has participated\
    \ on a number of phone calls and researched source materials for both papers.\
    \ NCSL has been working directly with EPSA to revise the draft outline and participated\
    \ on multiple calls with NASEO to discuss the best approach and share resources.\r\
    \nUnder task 1.6, NCSL rewrote a comprehensive report examining the current state\
    \ of nuclear power in the U.S. and what the spate of recent nuclear plant closures\
    \ means for the U.S. energy mix. The report highlights the role that state legislatures\
    \ play and policy options for states that wish to retain their current nuclear\
    \ fleet. This report was originally ready for publication in August 2016. At EPSA’s\
    \ request, NCSL held the report until the release of the QER. Given the topic\
    \ and developing actions related to nuclear power, NCSL rewrote the report with\
    \ updated information and state examples. Under task 1.7, NCSL answered a number\
    \ of information requests from state legislators and legislative staff related\
    \ to nuclear power. In particular, NCSL answered 3 requests asking for a summary\
    \ of state legislation that had been proposed or enacted by state legislatures\
    \ that would support the operation of nuclear power plants. Another request asked\
    \ for information on new nuclear power projects, along with state legislation\
    \ that supported new nuclear power developments. In addition, several requests\
    \ asked for detailed information regarding Illinois; S.B. 2814, the Future Energy\
    \ Jobs Bill, which among other things, provides support to struggling nuclear\
    \ power plants. Under task 1.1, NCSL has received comments on and revised outlines\
    \ of the two Energy-Water Nexus papers: Thermoelectric Cooling Water in Oil and\
    \ Gas Production. NCSL is in the process of researching and drafting the papers.\
    \ NCSL worked directly with EPSA during outline revisions and participated on\
    \ calls with NASEO to discuss the best approach and share resources. Under task\
    \ 1.6, NCSL published the report State Options to Keep Nuclear in the Energy Mix.\
    \ This report provides extensive background and discussion on issues that have\
    \ led to the premature closure of existing nuclear power generation and provides\
    \ information on state policies which support existing nuclear power. The report\
    \ was published as a PDF online and 1,000 copies were printed as well. In addition,\
    \ NCSL published a blog to promote the report. Under task 1.7, NCSL answered a\
    \ number of information requests from state legislators and legislative staff\
    \ related to nuclear power and testified on the topic. NCSL staff testified on\
    \ nuclear retention issues and state policy actions before the newly created Pennsylvania\
    \ Nuclear Energy Caucus. It is the first bipartisan, bicameral nuclear caucus\
    \ in the country. Under task 1.8, NCSL continued to update the database on a biweekly\
    \ basis and has entered and summarized all energy-water nexus related bills as\
    \ well as nuclear generation bills in all 50 states, commonwealths and territories.\
    \ They received nearly 650 web page visits per month on average.\r\n\r\nNARUC:\
    \ NARUC hosted a meeting to discuss Emerging Electricity Technologies and a Smart\
    \ Grid Federal-State Jurisdictional Boundaries and Opportunities for State Action.\
    \ The meeting addressed two major questions:\r\n1. What are the “flash points”\
    \ of federal-state jurisdiction on emerging electricity technologies?\r\n2. How\
    \ should the National Council on Electricity Policy (NCEP) – representing the\
    \ states – address these flash points? What can and should the NCEP do? \r\nNARUC\
    \ staff initiated a research project under direction from the EPSA office regarding\
    \ the aftermath of significant rate increases on state commissions. Starting from\
    \ an assumption that commissioners who oversee large electric rate or bill increases\
    \ may find themselves out of a job if a set of extenuating circumstances simultaneously\
    \ occur, NARUC embarked on a series of interviews with current and former commissioners\
    \ and a data gathering process to: \r\n(1) build more context around commissioner\
    \ duration and turnover, \r\n(2) study the incidence of significant rate or bill\
    \ increases, and \r\n(3) define extenuating circumstances such as media scrutiny,\
    \ political gridlock, additional infrastructure issues, and other characteristics\
    \ that may ameliorate or amplify the blowback of a rate or bill increase on commissioners.\
