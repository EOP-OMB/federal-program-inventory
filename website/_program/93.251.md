objective: "The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program supports comprehensive\
  \ and coordinated state and territory EHDI systems, so families with newborns, infants,\
  \ and young children up to three years of age who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH)\
  \ receive appropriate and timely services that include hearing screening, diagnosis,\
  \ and early intervention. This program supports state/territory efforts to build\
  \ systems of care focusing on increasing health professionals\u2019 engagement in\
  \ and knowledge of the EHDI system; improving access to early intervention services\
  \ and language acquisition; and improving family engagement, partnership, and leadership.\
  \ The EHDI program also provides support to two organizations that assist the states/territories\
  \ with technical assistance."

results:
- description: In FY 22, HRSA made awards to 50 states and 9 territories to strengthen
    their capacity to implement statewide EHDI programs including providing family
    support and engaging families with children who are DHH and adults who are DHH
    throughout the EHDI system. EHDI grantees leveraged HRSA funding to establish
    partnerships with family based organizations (FBOs) and increased access to family-to
    family supports including DHH mentors, role models and guides, and educated families
    on the importance of early language acquisition and enrollment in early intervention
    services for families with children identified as DHH.
