objective: The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program supports comprehensive
  and coordinated state and territory EHDI systems, so families with newborns, infants,
  and young children up to three years of age who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH)
  receive appropriate and timely services that include hearing screening, diagnosis,
  and early intervention. This program supports state/territory efforts to build systems
  of care focusing on increasing health professionalsâ€™ engagement in and knowledge
  of the EHDI system; improving access to early intervention services and language
  acquisition; and improving family engagement, partnership, and leadership. The EHDI
  program also provides support to two organizations that assist the states/territories
  with technical assistance.
