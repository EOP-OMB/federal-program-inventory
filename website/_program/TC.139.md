objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits under the regular
  tax rate schedule using broadly applicable measures of baseline income. It would
  not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income.
  In contrast, certain Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BC/BS) health insurance providers
  and certain other health insurers are provided with special tax benefits, provided
  that their percentage of total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical
  services provided to enrollees or for activities that improve health care quality
  is not less than 85 percent for the taxable year. A qualifying insurer may take
  as a deduction 100 percent of any net increase in its unearned premium reserves,
  instead of the 80 percent allowed other insurers. A qualifying insurer is also allowed
  a special deduction equal to the amount by which 25 percent of its health-claim
  expenses exceeds its beginning-of-the-year accounting surplus. The deduction is
  limited to the insurerâ€™s taxable income determined without the special deduction.
