- description: Program issued 15 awards through its continued work with partners in
    the development and implementation of conservation plans that contribute to improving
    the health of migratory bird species and their habitats and increasing opportunities
    for and access to outdoor recreation. The program also supported monitoring activities
    that provide critical data used in the establishment of annual migratory bird
    hunting seasons that, in turn, provide hunting opportunities for the American
    public.
  year: '2022'
- description: The program will continue to conduct conservation and monitoring activities
    like prior years, including using vehicles like the Urban Bird Treaty to expand
    outreach efforts and activities to better reach under-served communities. The
    program will also award $100,000 to further our understanding of conditions that
    affect webless species of migratory birds.
