objective: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) receives funds for implementation
  of the Yukon River Salmon Agreement with Canada which was reached in March 2001.  The
  Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000 authorizes funds for implementation of the Agreement
  including funds for cooperative research and management projects on the Alaska portion
  of the Yukon River.  The Service administers these funds through financial assistance
  on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance the scientific community’s
  understanding and management of Chinook and chum salmon in the Yukon River of Alaska.
