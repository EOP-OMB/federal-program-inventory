objective: The goal of this program is to assist eligible schools in supporting programs
  of excellence in health professions education for underrepresented minority (URM)
  individuals. The Centers of Excellence (COE) program is a catalyst for institutionalizing
  a commitment to underrepresented minority (URM) students/faculty and to serve as
  a national resource and educational center for diversity and minority health issues.
  Additionally, the COE program will help to strengthen the national capacity to produce
  a culturally competent healthcare workforce whose diversity is representative of
  the United States population.

results:
- description: In Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022, the COE program trained 4,027 students
    to apply to a health professions training program or maintain enrollment in such
    programs. A total of 1,958 students completed a COE program. Eighty-nine percent
    of these program completers were underrepresented minorities..  In partnership
    with 183 health care delivery sites, COE grantees provided 2,888 clinical training
    experiences to health professions trainees.  These clinical experiences are designed
    to help prepare health professions students to provide quality health care to
    diverse populations.  The training emphasizes the importance of cultural competency
    and the impact of health disparities on overall health outcomes COEs developed
    or enhanced 485 courses, reaching 16,213 people. COEs provided in-depth support
    to a subset of 1,854 students through structured training programs (e.g., summer
    programs, high school academies). The subset of trainees received additional academic,
    social, and financial support, such as academic advising (82 percent), counseling
    (73 percent), and stipends (71 percent) to help them progress through the health
    professions pipeline. Over 99 percent of COE structured program trainees were
    underrepresented minorities and 72 percent were from disadvantaged backgrounds.
