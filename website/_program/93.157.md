objective: The goal of this program is to assist eligible schools in supporting programs
  of excellence in health professions education for underrepresented minority (URM)
  individuals. The Centers of Excellence (COE) program is a catalyst for institutionalizing
  a commitment to underrepresented minority (URM) students/faculty and to serve as
  a national resource and educational center for diversity and minority health issues.
  Additionally, the COE program will help to strengthen the national capacity to produce
  a culturally competent healthcare workforce whose diversity is representative of
  the United States population.
