objective: The goal of this program is to assist eligible schools in supporting programs
  of excellence in health professions education for underrepresented minority (URM)

  Additionally, the COE program will help to strengthen the national capacity to produce
  a culturally competent healthcare workforce whose diversity is representative of
  the United States population.
