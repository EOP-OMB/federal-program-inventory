objective: 'SNAP Benefits: Improve nutrition of eligible low-income households by
  ensuring access to nutritious, healthful diets through the issuance of monthly benefits
  that are used for the purchase of food at authorized retailers as well as nutrition
  education.


  Contingency Fund:  Placed in reserve for use only in such amounts and at such times
  as may be necessary to carry out program operations.  Enables the program to react
  to shifts in program need that were not anticipated at the time of a budget request.


  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA):  This project ended in FY2014. The
  purpose of this project was to stimulate the economy following the Great Recession.


  Healthy Incentive Pilot: This project ended in FY2014.  The purpose was to determine
  if incentives provided to SNAP recipients at the point-of-sale increase the purchase
  of fruits, vegetables or other healthful foods.'
