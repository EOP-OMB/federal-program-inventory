objective: "Funds will support a comprehensive research plan to compile, categorize,\
  \ analyze, and publicize methodologically sound information on People\u2019s Republic\
  \ of China (PRC) international economic influence.   The information will allow\
  \ developing countries, including in South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific,\
  \ to assess more accurately the risks associated with PRC technology acquisition\
  \ and deployment plans, and help them build alliances to combat unfair economic\
  \ practices.  This project will fill persistent knowledge gaps and produce a high-resolution\
  \ map of all major PRC Government industrial and advanced technology initiatives,\
  \ using proven research methods to identify detailed information on priorities,\
  \ implementing institutions, and policy tools.  It will provide a detailed understanding\
  \ of how high-level, high-profile PRC policy initiatives translate into discrete\
  \ actions and support for PRC industry throughout all levels of government, particularly\
  \ as they interface with PRC private and state-owned firms.  The project will significantly\
  \ expand global understanding of PRC digital investments, Military-Civil Fusion,\
  \ and other technology innovation efforts.  The implementing partner will provide\
  \ this information through outreach to targeted countries. Activities may include\
  \ conferences for ESF-eligible countries globally that convene the research teams\
  \ to share, evaluate and cross validate results.  The program\u2019s research outputs\
  \ will be publicly available and include information detailing PRC cyber, ICT, and\
  \ emerging technology plans and intentions, easily accessible by governments, academics,\
  \ journalists, and NGOs."
