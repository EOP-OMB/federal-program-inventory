objective: The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program (CBWP) helps agricultural producers
  improve water quality and quantity, and restore, enhance, and preserve soil, air,
  and related resources in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed through the implementation
  of conservation practices.  These conservation practices reduce soil erosion and
  nutrient levels in ground and surface water; improve, restore, and enhance wildlife
  habitat; and help address air quality and related natural resource concerns.  CBWP
  encompasses all tributaries, backwaters, and side channels, including their watersheds,
  draining into the Chesapeake Bay.
