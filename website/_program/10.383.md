objective: "The purpose of FPEP is to expand capacity, improve competition, and increase\
  \ supply chain resilience within the agricultural fertilizer and nutrient management\
  \ sector, in connection with the production of agricultural commodities.  To meet\
  \ its purpose, FPEP will support the production of agricultural commodities through\
  \ the manufacturing and processing of fertilizer and nutrient alternatives that\
  \ are:\n\n•\tIndependent and outside the dominant fertilizer suppliers.  The goal\
  \ is to increase competition.  Consequently, entities that hold a market share (in\
  \ either manufacturing, processing, or distribution) that is greater than or equal\
  \ to the entity that holds the fourth largest share of the market for nitrogen,\
  \ phosphate, or potash, as applicable, will not be considered for funding;\n\n•\t\
  Made in America - Produced in the U.S. by companies located in the U.S. and territories,\
  \ creating good-paying jobs at home, and reducing the reliance on potentially unstable\
  \ or inconsistent foreign supplies;\n\n•\tInnovative – To improve upon fertilizer\
  \ production methods and efficient-use technologies to jump start the next generation\
  \ of fertilizers and nutrient alternatives;\n\n•\tSustainable - Reduces the greenhouse\
  \ gas impact of transportation, production, and use through renewable energy sources,\
  \ feedstocks, formulations, and incentivizing greater precision in fertilizer use;\
  \ and\n\n•\tFarmer-focused - a driving factor will be making sure the additional\
  \ capacity supported by USDA is dedicated to U.S. agricultural commodity\nproduction."
