objective: The Lead-Based Paint and Housing-Related Hazards are for Public Housing
  Authorities (PHAs) to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint and other housing-related
  hazards including carbon monoxide and mold in public housing, and for other costs
  associated with public housing asset improvement. The Lead-Based Paint Capital Fund
  Program provides competitive grants to PHAs to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint
  hazards in public housing by carrying out the activities of risk assessments, abatement,
  and interim controls (as those terms are defined in section 1004 of the Residential
  Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851b)). The Housing-Related
  Hazards Capital Fund Program provides funds for PHAs to prevent and correct significant
  housing-related health and safety hazards such as mold and carbon monoxide in public
  housing.
