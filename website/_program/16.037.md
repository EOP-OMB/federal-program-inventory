objective: "The goals of the Strengthening the Medical Examiner-Coroner System Program\
  \ are:  \n\n • Purpose Area 1: Forensic Pathology Fellowships—Increase the number\
  \ of qualified forensic pathology practitioners.  \n\n• Purpose Area 2: Medical\
  \ Examiner-Coroner Office Accreditation—Strengthen the quality and consistency of\
  \ ME/C services in their respective offices, thereby increasing public trust in\
  \ these services. BJA expects applicants to clearly identify the purpose area to\
  \ which they are applying. If applicants request funds from both purpose areas,\
  \ they must submit a separate application for each purpose area.   \n\nObjectives:\
  \  \nPurpose Area 1: Forensic Pathology Fellowships—Recruit quality candidates who\
  \ have completed all of the necessary medical education and pathology residency\
  \ requirements by soliciting applications from institutions with current Accreditation\
  \ Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited forensic pathology fellowship\
  \ programs.  \n\n Purpose Area 2: Medical Examiner-Coroner Office Accreditation—Ensure\
  \ that agencies performing postmortem examinations are following industry and professional\
  \ standards and performance criteria. \n\nPerformance Measure 1: The number of participants\
  \ who completed forensic pathology fellowship training under the Strengthening the\
  \ Medical Examiner-Coroner System Program; and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number\
  \ of individuals who obtained accreditation from an appropriate medical examiner-coroner\
  \ accrediting agency using Strengthening the Medical Examiner-Coroner System Program\
  \ funding during the reporting period."

- description: 'Fellowship/Purpose Area 1

    • 39 fellowships funded by this program.

    • 15 participants have completed fellowship training using

    program funds.

    • 2,306 deaths were investigated by the program funded

    fellows.

    • 2,217 autopsies were performed by the program funded

    fellows.

    Accreditation/Purpose Area 2

    • 73 individuals seeking certification using program funds.

    • 12 individuals achieved certification using program funds.

    • 3 organizations have achieved accreditation using program funds.

    *Please note that due to COVID 19, many grantee’s program goals were delayed,
    especially with respect to accreditation.

    **Success Stories:

    The autopsy performance by the fellow reduced the

    overall caseload average for the full time forensic

    pathologists, helping to keep them below 325 annual

    autopsies, preserving critical criteria that must be met for

    NAME accreditation . The fellowship was an affordable

    and cost effective approach to solving concerns

    regarding record autopsy numbers, as well as by

    bolstering forensic pathology of the future, by providing

    two well trained forensic pathologists to an undermanned

    field. Montgomery County Coroner’s Office , Ohio

    With the hiring of this fellow, MCMEO was able to

    increase the number of autopsies performed by 6% when

    compared with the twelve months prior and allowed the

    office to offer support to surrounding jurisdictions in need

    of forensic autopsy services. During this timeframe,

    MCMEO was able to provide autopsy support to 14 other

    jurisdictions, which is an increase of more than 100%

    from years prior ~Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office'
