    *Please note that due to COVID 19, many grantee’s program goals were delayed,
    especially with respect to accreditation.

    **Success Stories:

    The autopsy performance by the fellow reduced the

    overall caseload average for the full time forensic

    pathologists, helping to keep them below 325 annual

    autopsies, preserving critical criteria that must be met for

    NAME accreditation . The fellowship was an affordable

    and cost effective approach to solving concerns

    regarding record autopsy numbers, as well as by

    bolstering forensic pathology of the future, by providing

    two well trained forensic pathologists to an undermanned

    field. Montgomery County Coroner’s Office , Ohio

    With the hiring of this fellow, MCMEO was able to

    increase the number of autopsies performed by 6% when

    compared with the twelve months prior and allowed the

    office to offer support to surrounding jurisdictions in need

    of forensic autopsy services. During this timeframe,

    MCMEO was able to provide autopsy support to 14 other

    jurisdictions, which is an increase of more than 100%

    from years prior ~Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office'
