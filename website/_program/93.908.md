objective: The Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (Nurse Corps LRP) provides loan
  repayment assistance to professional registered nurses (RN), including advanced
  practice registered nurses (APRNs), in return for a commitment to work full-time
  in eligible health care facilities with a critical shortage of nurses or serve as
  a nurse faculty in an eligible school of nursing. Nurse Corps LRP decreases the
  economic barriers associated with pursuing careers at Critical Shortage Facilities
  or in academic school of nursing.

- description: "In FY21, the American Rescue Plan Act provided the Nurse Corps Program\
    \ with $200 million\nin additional funding to support the nation’s COVID-19 emergency\
    \ response. In FY23, the\nremaining American Rescue Plan Act funds allowed HRSA\
    \ to further bolster the nursing.\nworkforce with a total of 505 Nurse Corps Loan\
    \ Repayment Program continuation awards to\nnurses serving in Critical Shortage\
    \ Facilities and at accredited schools of nursing. By using the remaining American\
    \ Rescue Plan Act funds to make continuation awards in FY23, HRSA was able to\
    \ make additional new awards, totaling 492 new and 505 continuation awards. \n\
    \nTo address the opioid epidemic and other substance use disorders across the\
    \ nation,\nthe Nurse Corps LRP continues supporting the behavioral health nursing\
    \ workforce. In FY\n24, Nurse Corps LRP awarded 60 nurse practitioners specializing\
    \ in psychiatric-mental health. The program also continues to dedicate a portion\
    \ of the loan repayment awards to nurses specializing in women’s health and made\
    \ 58 awards.\n\nIn FY24, The Nurse Corps discontinued the set-aside for Public\
    \ Health Nurse because the requirement could not be met by the applicants in most\
    \ states, the certification no longer existed, and the set-aside/number of awards\
    \ were small in comparison to the burden to continue. The program awarded 377\
    \ new and 656 continuation awards.  As of September 30, 2024, the Nurse Corps\
    \ field strength comprised 1,753 nurses working in Critical Shortage Facilities\
    \ located in Health Professional Shortage Areas and nurse faculty members working\
    \ in academic institutions."
