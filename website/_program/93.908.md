objective: The Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (Nurse Corps LRP) provides loan
  repayment assistance to professional registered nurses (RN), including advanced
  practice registered nurses (APRNs), in return for a commitment to work full-time
  in eligible health care facilities with a critical shortage of nurses or serve as
  a nurse faculty in an eligible school of nursing. Nurse Corps LRP decreases the
  economic barriers associated with pursuing careers at Critical Shortage Facilities
  or in academic school of nursing.
