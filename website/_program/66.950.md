  and studies. As required by Public Law 101-619, funds are provided to universities,

  EE field. The goals of the current teacher training program--ee360+-- are to: 1)
  Drive Educator Excellence, which includes in-person and on-line training and the
  development of and updating of current Guidelines for Excellence; 2) Cultivating
  Collective Impact, which includes supporting state capacity building; 3) Mobilizing
  Access to High-Quality Resources and Networks, which includes maintaining eePRO;
  and 4) Maintaining Project Excellence through Evaluation, Communication and Management.
  ee360+ supports a diverse cadre of environmental education leaders through certification,
  accreditation, leadership training, state-of-the-art education materials and research,
