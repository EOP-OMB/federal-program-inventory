objective: On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Consolidated
  Appropriations Act) was signed into law. Among other actions intended to provide
  relief during the pandemic, the Consolidated Appropriations Act established an Emergency
  Broadband Connectivity Fund of $3.2 billion in the Treasury of the United States
  for the fiscal year 2021. The Act directed the Federal Communications Commission
  (FCC or Commission) to use that fund to establish an Emergency Broadband Benefit
  Program (EBB Program), under which eligible low-income households may receive a
  discount off the cost of broadband service and certain connected devices during
  an emergency period relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and participating providers
  can receive a reimbursement for such discounts. The Commission voted to adopt the
  EBB Program rules, and pursuant to statutory requirements, the final order was adopted
  on February 25, 2021. The EBB Program launched on May 12, 2021. On November 15,
  2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Infrastructure Act) was signed
  into law.  Pursuant to the Infrastructure Act, the Affordable Connectivity Program
  builds on the EBB Program by using new funding to provide discounted broadband service
  and connected devices to low-income households. The Infrastructure Act leaves the
  EBB Program’s basic framework in place, but it does make changes to the benefit
  amount, rules regarding plan and subscriber eligibility, and providers’ public promotion
  obligations, among other changes, and appropriates an additional $14.2 billion to
  implement those changes. The Commission adopted the Affordable Connectivity Program
  rules on January 14, 2022.
