objective: "On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Consolidated\
  \ Appropriations Act) was signed into law. Among other actions intended to provide\
  \ relief during the pandemic, the Consolidated Appropriations Act established an\
  \ Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund of $3.2 billion in the Treasury of the United\
  \ States for the fiscal year 2021. The Act directed the Federal Communications Commission\
  \ (FCC or Commission) to use that fund to establish an Emergency Broadband Benefit\
  \ Program (EBB Program), under which eligible low-income households may receive\
  \ a discount off the cost of broadband service and certain connected devices during\
  \ an emergency period relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and participating providers\
  \ can receive a reimbursement for such discounts. The Commission voted to adopt\
  \ the EBB Program rules, and pursuant to statutory requirements, the final order\
  \ was adopted on February 25, 2021. The EBB Program launched on May 12, 2021. On\
  \ November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Infrastructure\
  \ Act) was signed into law.  Pursuant to the Infrastructure Act, the Affordable\
  \ Connectivity Program builds on the EBB Program by using new funding to provide\
  \ discounted broadband service and connected devices to low-income households. The\
  \ Infrastructure Act leaves the EBB Program\u2019s basic framework in place, but\
  \ it does make changes to the benefit amount, rules regarding plan and subscriber\
  \ eligibility, and providers\u2019 public promotion obligations, among other changes,\
  \ and appropriates an additional $14.2 billion to implement those changes. The Commission\
  \ adopted the Affordable Connectivity Program rules on January 14, 2022."
