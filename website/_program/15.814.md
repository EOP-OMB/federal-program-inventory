- description: 'Thirty-seven states submitted applications. No further information
    is available, because funds have not yet been obligated. Thirty-three states submitted
    applications. Thirty states were awarded grants totaling $968,583. Successful
    state applicants funded 14,256 student hours. Funded data preservation efforts
    included: preserving, digitizing, and publicly exposing on the Web aerial imagery,
    engineering reports, and geologic hazards maps and documents; preserving unique
    and valuable rock samples and cores, often with associated geophysical logs, maps,
    and other data, by improving storage conditions, repackaging, and digitizing for
    public exposure on the Web; and scanning and archiving oil and gas well records
    to encourage natural resource development and inform geologic investigations.
    In partnership with Association of American State Geologists, the NGGDPP conducted
    a successful Data Rescue and Preservation Workshop, attended by 60 representatives
    primarily from state geological surveys, to educate and share information about
    reliable practices for the preservation and public exposure of valuable data and
    materials to promote their use in geoscience investigations.'

    photographing rock thin sections for preservation and posting on the Web for direct
    study; preserving, photographing, and publicly exposing on the Web valuable rock
    cores, including rare cores drilled along the U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental
