- description: 'In 2022, states submitted 34 applications, with 33 states awarded
    at least partial funding, to total $4,281,028. The funding supports 37,173 student
    hours. Funded data preservation efforts include: digitization and standardization
    to GeMS format of paper geologic maps and databases to enable integration with
    other maps and spatially-relevant data; compiling, digitizing and making available
    maps, geochemical data, geophysical logs, field notebooks and mining records relevant
    to critical minerals; developing databases for geochemical, oil and gas, and critical
    minerals data; compiling borehole information, preserving, photographing, and
    publicly exposing on the Web valuable rock cores for study and analysis and preserving
    well records and related cuttings collections to advance geologic studies and
    resource development. A total of 51 geologic maps will be converted to GeMS format.
    The geoscience data, collections, and artifacts preserved by state geological
    surveys are described in ReSciColl (Registry of Scientific Collections), at https://webapps.usgs.gov/rescicoll/index.html

    and information about the NGGDPP is available at https://datapreservation.usgs.gov.'

- description: 'In 2023, states submitted 33 applications, with 32 states planned
    for award with at least partial funding, estimated to total $5,837,103. The estimated
    funding is planned to support 41,129 student hours. Funded data preservation efforts
    will include: digitization and standardization to GeMS format of paper geologic
    maps and databases to enable integration with other maps and spatially-relevant
    data; compiling, digitizing and making available maps, geochemical data, geophysical
    logs, mining records relevant to critical minerals; developing databases for geochemical,
    oil and gas, and critical minerals data; compiling borehole information, preserving,
    photographing, and publicly exposing on the Web valuable rock cores for study
    and analysis and preserving well records and related cuttings collections to advance
    geologic studies and resource development. Construction projects will provide
    long term storage conditions and access to valuable collections of cores, cuttings
    and other physical samples. A total of 52 geologic maps are planned for conversion
    to GeMS format. The geoscience data, collections, and artifacts preserved by state
    geological surveys are described in ReSciColl (Registry of Scientific Collections),
