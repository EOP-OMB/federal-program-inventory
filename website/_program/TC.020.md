objective: The baseline tax system generally takes a comprehensive view of taxable
  income that includes a wide variety of (measurable) accretions to wealth. In certain
  circumstances, public utilities offer rate subsidies to non-business customers who
  invest in energy conservation measures. These rate subsidies are equivalent to payments
  from the utility to its customer, and so represent accretions to wealth, income
  that would be taxable to the customer under the baseline tax system. In contrast,
  the Tax Code exempts these subsidies from the non-business customerâ€™s gross income.
