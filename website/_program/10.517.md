objective: 'The Tribal College Extension Program supports the 1994 Land-Grants to
  create extension offices for their reservation communities. Each extension office
  works with reservation communities to build programs that target local needs. The
  result is a diversified and targeted outreach. Reservation youth participate in
  fun activities in a safe environment. Farmers and ranchers gain science-based insights
  to improve their productivity.

  Financial literacy training enhances rural reservation economies. The 1994 Land-Grants
  also provide culture-centered family activities to restore Native languages, traditions
  and agriculture. Within this grant program are two types of funds: Capacity grants
  and Special Emphasis. Capacity grants fund an entire Extension office which can
  have many mission areas and clients. Special Emphasis are targeted, short-term pilot
  projects that allow Extension educators to explore new ways to better serve their
  community.'
