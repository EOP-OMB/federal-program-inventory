objective: "This listing is no longer in use.\n\nThe mission of the National Institute\
  \ on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) is to lead scientific research\
  \ to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities. To accomplish this,\
  \ NIMHD 1) Plans, reviews, coordinates, and evaluates all minority health and health\
  \ disparities research and activities of the National Institutes of Health; 2) Conducts\
  \ and supports research in minority health and health disparities; 3) Promotes and\
  \ supports the training of a diverse research workforce; 4) Translates and disseminates\
  \ research information; 5) Fosters innovative collaborations and partnerships.\n\
  \nThere are two separate types of loan repayment within NIMHD's Loan Repayment Program:\
  \ (1) Extramural Loan Repayment Program for Health Disparities Research (LRP-HDR):\
  \ recruits and retains qualified health professionals to research careers that focus\
  \ on minority health disparities research or other health disparities research and\
  \ the (2) Extramural Clinical Research Loan Repayment Program for Individuals from\
  \ Disadvantaged Backgrounds (LRP\xAD IDB), recruits and retains qualified health\
  \ professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds to conduct clinical research.\n\n\
  The objective of these extramural loan repayment programs are to recruit and retain\
  \ qualified health professionals including those from health disparity populations\
  \ and those from disadvantaged backgrounds to conduct minority health disparities\
  \ research, other health disparities research, and clinical research.\n\n(1) Health\
  \ Disparities Research may pertain to basic, clinical, or behavioral research on\
  \ health disparity populations (including individual members and communities of\
  \ such populations), that relate to health disparities, including the causes of\
  \ such disparities and methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat such disparities.\
  \ \n\n(2) Clinical research consists of patient-oriented clinical research conducted\
  \ with human subjects, or research on the causes and consequences of disease in\
  \ human populations involving material of human origin (such as tissue specimens\
  \ and cognitive phenomena) for which the investigator or colleague directly interacts\
  \ with human subjects in an outpatient or inpatient setting to clarify a problem\
  \ in human physiology, pathophysiology or disease, or epidemiologic or behavioral\
  \ studies, outcomes research or health services research, or developing new technologies,\
  \ therapeutic interventions, or clinical trials."
