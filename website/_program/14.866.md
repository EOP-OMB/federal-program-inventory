objective: Revitalization Grants enable PHAs to improve the living environment for
  public housing residents of severely distressed public housing projects through
  the demolition, substantial rehabilitation, reconfiguration, and/or replacement
  of severely distressed units; revitalize the sites on which severely distressed
  public housing projects are located and contribute to the improvement of the surrounding
  neighborhood; lessen isolation and reduce the concentration of low-income families;
  build sustainable mixed-income communities; and provide well-coordinated, results-based
  community and supportive services that directly complement housing redevelopment
  and that help residents to achieve self-sufficiency, young people to obtain educational
  excellence, and the community to secure a desirable quality of life.
