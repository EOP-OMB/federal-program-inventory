objective: 'The goal of the Source Reduction Assistance (SRA) program is to award
  grants that support research, investigation, study, demonstration, education and
  training using source reduction approaches (also known as “pollution prevention”
  and herein referred to as “P2”). P2 means reducing or eliminating pollutants from
  entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to recycling,
  treatment, or disposal. This program provides applicants the opportunity to utilize
  hands on practical P2 tools, information and/or innovative P2 approaches to measurably
  improve the public health and the surrounding environment, by reducing the use of
  hazardous substances, reducing toxic pollutants, supporting efficiencies in reducing
  resource use (e.g., water and energy), and reducing business expenditures and liability
  costs. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: SRA assistance agreements must carry
  out activities within the terms of EPA''s statutory authorities. The statutes allow
  the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements that use technical assistance
  methods of: research, investigation, experiments, education, training, studies,
  and/or demonstration of innovative techniques to perform source reduction work.
  SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring information
  or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this "learning" concept, as opposed
  to "fixing" an environmental problem using a well-established method. For projects
  that will support demonstration activity, the project must involve new or experimental
  technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results of the project will be disseminated
  so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project.
  A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional,
  or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task
  rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile
  the project might be, is not a demonstration. In addition, projects must demonstrate
  how source reduction approaches are new or experimental and how the project otherwise
  meets the requirements of a demonstration as described in the applicable SRA grant
  announcement. If the project uses technologies, methods or approaches that have
  been used previously in other geographic areas and/or business sectors, then an
  explanation must be provided in the applicant''s proposal noting how the demonstration
  project is different from such prior projects and is a true demonstration. The applicant
  must also explain what will be learned from the demonstration. If the project is
  truly a demonstration and complies with other eligibility and grant threshold factors,
  then it will be considered for funding. Projects that principally support recycling,
  clean-up, treatment, disposal and/or energy recovery efforts (e.g., incinerating
  solid waste to generate electricity) will not be considered for funding.'
