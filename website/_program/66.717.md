objective: The goal of the Source Reduction Assistance (SRA) program is to award grants
  that support research, investigation, study, demonstration, education and training
  using source reduction approaches (also known as “pollution prevention” and herein
  referred to as “P2”). P2 means reducing or eliminating pollutants from entering
  any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to recycling,
  treatment, or disposal. This program provides applicants the opportunity to utilize
  hands on practical P2 tools, information and/or innovative P2 approaches to measurably
  improve the public health and the surrounding environment, by reducing the use of
  hazardous substances, reducing toxic pollutants, supporting efficiencies in reducing
  resource use (e.g., water and energy), and reducing business expenditures and liability
  costs. In FY 2025, SRA will continue to fund activities that promote practical source
  reduction practices, tools, and training on P2 approaches to measurably improve
  human and environmental health by reducing the use of hazardous substances, reducing
  toxic pollutants, reducing resource use (e.g., water and energy) and reducing expenditures
  and liability costs to businesses, non-profit organizations and/or communities.

  year: '2022'
- description: Between 2011 and 2022, EPA’s P2 and Source Reduction Assistance Grants
    have topped the one-billion-pound mark for reductions in hazardous materials and
    pollutants. In addition, cost savings of $2.3 billion resulted from companies
    buying fewer hazardous materials and shipping less hazardous waste, reducing regulated
    air emissions, treating less wastewater and buying less water, fuel and energy.
    Further success from these grants includes 20.8 million metric tons of greenhouse
    gas reductions and 31.9 billion kilowatt hour savings achieved mostly through
    energy efficiency and reduced use of energy.  You can view Grant Summaries of
    past SRA awards from 2010 through 2023 at https://www.epa.gov/p2/summary-pollution-prevention-and-source-reduction-assistance-grant-awards.
