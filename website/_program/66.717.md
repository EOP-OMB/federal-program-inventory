objective: "The goal of the Source Reduction Assistance (SRA) program is to award\
  \ grants that support research, investigation, study, demonstration, education and\
  \ training using source reduction approaches (also known as \u201Cpollution prevention\u201D\
  \ and herein referred to as \u201CP2\u201D). P2 means reducing or eliminating pollutants\
  \ from entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment prior\
  \ to recycling, treatment, or disposal. This program provides applicants the opportunity\
  \ to utilize hands on practical P2 tools, information and/or innovative P2 approaches\
  \ to measurably improve the public health and the surrounding environment, by reducing\
  \ the use of hazardous substances, reducing toxic pollutants, supporting efficiencies\
  \ in reducing resource use (e.g., water and energy), and reducing business expenditures\
  \ and liability costs. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: SRA assistance agreements\
  \ must carry out activities within the terms of EPA's statutory authorities. The\
  \ statutes allow the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements that use technical\
  \ assistance methods of: research, investigation, experiments, education, training,\
  \ studies, and/or demonstration of innovative techniques to perform source reduction\
  \ work. SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring\
  \ information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this \"learning\"\
  \ concept, as opposed to \"fixing\" an environmental problem using a well-established\
  \ method. For projects that will support demonstration activity, the project must\
  \ involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results\
  \ of the project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge\
  \ gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the\
  \ performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that\
  \ is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance\
  \ the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration.\
  \ In addition, projects must demonstrate how source reduction approaches are new\
  \ or experimental and how the project otherwise meets the requirements of a demonstration\
  \ as described in the applicable SRA grant announcement. If the project uses technologies,\
  \ methods or approaches that have been used previously in other geographic areas\
  \ and/or business sectors, then an explanation must be provided in the applicant's\
  \ proposal noting how the demonstration project is different from such prior projects\
  \ and is a true demonstration. The applicant must also explain what will be learned\
  \ from the demonstration. If the project is truly a demonstration and complies with\
  \ other eligibility and grant threshold factors, then it will be considered for\
  \ funding. Projects that principally support recycling, clean-up, treatment, disposal\
  \ and/or energy recovery efforts (e.g., incinerating solid waste to generate electricity)\
  \ will not be considered for funding."
