objective: 'This program funds Marine Turtle and Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle (TFT)
  projects. Objectives of the Marine Turtle projects are to assist in the conservation
  of marine turtles and the nesting habitats of marine turtles in foreign countries
  by supporting and providing financial resources in the following areas: academic
  and technical training in the conservation and management of marine turtles; applied
  research on marine turtle populations and their habitats, including surveys and
  monitoring; conservation education and community outreach for the protection of
  nesting and near shore foraging populations; development and execution of marine
  turtle conservation management plans; habitat conservation and management; information
  exchange to promote international collaboration; projects to protect nesting females
  and eggs on important nesting beaches; promotion of networks, partnerships, and
  coalitions that assist in the implementation of conventions, treaties, protocols
  and other international activities for the conservation and management of marine
  turtles; protected area/reserve management of important nesting beaches; strengthening
  local capacity to implement conservation programs on nesting beaches; and strengthening
  law enforcement capacity and forensics skills through training and equipment. Tortoise
  and Freshwater Turtles (TFT) represent one of the most imperiled animal groups on
  earth. Of the world''s 342 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles, more than
  half face the threat of extinction. Habitat loss and the legal and illegal trade
  of turtles and turtle products (for food, pets, and traditional medicines, etc.)
  continue to drive sharp declines in turtle populations globally. The USFWS TFT Conservation
  Fund aims to support conservation efforts that conserve populations and habitats
  of freshwater turtles and tortoises most at risk by addressing their threats.'
