objective: "This program has two parts:\n1.)  Capacity Assistance – Urban Agriculture\
  \ Conservation Extension Educator: Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\
  \ is experiencing a large influx of small-scale and urban producers and needs additional\
  \ capacity to meet this demand effectively. To bolster customer service to urban\
  \ producers, experienced Urban Agriculture Extension Educators will be employed\
  \ to deliver technical assistance and link producers to NRCS conservation planning\
  \ and program opportunities. These positions will be administered through the Cooperative\
  \ Extension Service at the participating Land Grant Universities (LGUs) in the CURE\
  \ program, in collaboration and coordination with NRCS state offices, will have\
  \ priority duties that include: \na) Working with NRCS to guide urban agriculture\
  \ producers conserve, maintain, and restore natural resources on their lands while\
  \ improving the health of their operations and creating a more productive and resilient\
  \ landscape. \nb)  Providing direct technical assistance to urban producers to help\
  \ identify resource concerns and develop science-based solutions for addressing\
  \ their conservation priorities. \nc) Assisting producers with awareness of zoning,\
  \ permitting, and administrative complexities associated with conservation practice\
  \ implementation. \nd)  Assisting producers with climate-smart mitigating activities\
  \ which deliver quantifiable greenhouse gas reductions. \ne) Assessing the conservation\
  \ needs and assisting innovative forms of agricultural production including controlled\
  \ environment agriculture systems. \nf) Applying experience and academic resources\
  \ to provide urban agriculture training to NRCS employees and partners.\ng)  Coordinating\
  \ with NRCS and the Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP)\
  \ to evaluate the needs of urban agriculture producers, tailor services towards\
  \ these needs, and conduct outreach to best reach new customers.   \n\n2.)Impact\
  \ Collaborative – Scalable urban agriculture service strategy: The other primary\
  \ component of this initiative is the development of an Impact Collaborative for\
  \ urban agriculture service delivery with prioritization towards the 27 Urban Agriculture\
  \ identified areas (listed above). An Impact Collaborative is a program administered\
  \ by the Extension Foundation (ExF) that helps partners inform, strengthen, and\
  \ innovate their project and program development to create greater local impact\
  \ in their counties and states. Its methodology is founded in design-thinking and\
  \ has been developed in partnership with Cooperative Extension professionals since\
  \ 2014. There are currently 190 trained Impact Facilitators to assist with project\
  \ designs, and Key Informants (Subject Matter Experts) that can be utilized to inform\
  \ discussions. Attendees for this Impact Collaborative will include representatives\
  \ from NRCS, including OUAIP, NIFA, NUEL, NUREC, and Extension professionals currently\
  \ working in the urban conservation space. During the three-day Collaborative, teams\
  \ will develop solutions to questions that include: \n\n\ta) What are the needs\
  \ of the urban agriculture producer, both general and unique\n\tb) What pieces of\
  \ the puzzle can NRCS provide?  \t\t\t\n\tc) Who can potentially address other needs\
  \ beyond NRCS authorities?\n\td) How can this project be scaled to other cities,\
  \ suburbs, and towns?\n\nOutputs from this process will include: \n\ta) Plan for\
  \ addressing technical assistance needs - state/national\t\n\tb) Plan for addressing\
  \ financial assistance needs - state/national\t\n\tc) Plan for addressing needs\
  \ beyond NRCS authorities - state/national\n\td) Plan for scaling projects from\
  \ urban focal areas to other locations and statewide\n\te) Plan for National NRCS\
  \ supporting the states going forward."
