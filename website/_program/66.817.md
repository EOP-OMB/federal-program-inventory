objective: "Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse\
  \ of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous\
  \ substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\nThe primary objectives of EPA's CERCLA\
  \ Section 128(a) State and Tribal Response Program grants are to provide financial\
  \ support to States, US Territories, and Tribal Nations to (1) establish or enhance\
  \ the four statutory elements of an effective state or Tribal response program,\
  \ as specified in CERCLA Section 128(a)(2); (2) maintain and update, at least annually,\
  \ a public record of sites, pursuant to CERCLA Section 128(b), that includes the\
  \ name and location of sites at which response actions have been completed during\
  \ the previous year and the name and location of sites at which response actions\
  \ are planned to be addressed in the next year; and (3) conduct a limited number\
  \ of brownfield site assessments or cleanups that will help establish or enhance\
  \ the state or Tribal Nation’s response program. Additional funding for the CERCLA\
  \ 128(a) Grants was authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\
  \ Data from grant recipients is collected within the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment\
  \ Exchange System (ACRES) and used to demonstrate successful implementation of the\
  \ program. In addition, the CERCLA Section 128(a) grant program provides technical\
  \ assistance funding for training and research to small communities, Indian tribes,\
  \ rural communities, and disadvantaged areas as defined in CERCLA Section 128(a)(1)(B)(III)(iv).\
  \ \nCertain projects (i.e., primarily cleanup projects) are subject to the Buy America\
  \ Sourcing requirements under the Build America, Buy America (BABA) provisions IIJA\
  \ (P.L. 117-58, §§ 70911-70917) when using funds for the purchase of goods, products,\
  \ and materials on any form of construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair\
  \ of infrastructure in the United States. The Buy America preference requirement\
  \ applies to all of the iron and steel, manufactured products, and construction\
  \ materials used for an infrastructure project under an award identified in EPA’s\
  \ financial assistance funding programs subject to BABA report.\nIn FY 2025, funding\
  \ will be prioritized as follows: (1) Funding for program development activities\
  \ to establish or enhance the four elements of a state or Tribal response program\
  \ and to enable states and Tribes to comply with the public record requirement in\
  \ CERCLA Section 128(b)(1)(C), including activities related to institutional controls.\
  \ States and tribes that have established one or more of the four elements will\
  \ not be hindered in funding distributions if their workplan includes activities\
  \ that enhance the four elements. States with Voluntary Cleanup Program Memorandum\
  \ of Agreement will not be prejudiced in funding distributions if their workplan\
  \ does not include tasks related to establishing or enhancing the four elements.\
  \ (2) Funding for program development activities to enhance the response program\
  \ or the cleanup capacity of a state or Tribal response program. (3) Funding for\
  \ site-specific activities at eligible brownfield sites. (4) Funding for environmental\
  \ insurance mechanisms. (5) Funding to capitalize brownfields RLFs. In addition,\
  \ pursuant to CERCLA Section 128(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III), the program will allocate up\
  \ to $1.5 M of CERCLA 104(k) funding for technical assistance grants to small communities,\
  \ Indian tribes, rural areas, or disadvantaged areas to carry out activities described\
  \ in 42 U.S. Code Section 9604(k)(7)(A). The maximum amount per technical assistance\
  \ grant is $20,000."
