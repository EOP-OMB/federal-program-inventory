objective: "The primary objectives of EPA's CERCLA Section 128(a) State and Tribal\
  \ Response Program grants are to provide financial support to States, US Territories,\
  \ and Tribal Nations to (1) establish or enhance the four statutory elements of\
  \ an effective state or Tribal response program, as specified in CERCLA Section\
  \ 128(a)(2), (2) maintain and update, at least annually, a public record of sites,\
  \ pursuant to CERCLA \xA7 128(b), that includes the name and location of sites at\
  \ which response actions have been completed during the previous year and the name\
  \ and location of sites at which response actions are planned to be addressed in\
  \ the next year, and (3) conduct a limited number of brownfield site assessments\
  \ or cleanups that will help establish or enhance the state or Tribal Nation\u2019\
  s response program. In addition, the CERCLA Section 128(a) grant program provides\
  \ technical assistance funding for training and research to small communities, Indian\
  \ tribes, rural communities, and disadvantaged areas as defined in CERCLA Section\
  \ 128(a)(1)(B)(III)(iv).  In FY 2024, funding will be prioritized as follows: (1)\
  \ Funding for program development activities to establish or enhance the four elements\
  \ of a state or Tribal response program and to enable states and Tribes to comply\
  \ with the public record requirement in Section 128(b)(1)(C), including activities\
  \ related to institutional controls. (States and tribes that have established one\
  \ or more of the four elements will not be prejudiced in funding distributions if\
  \ their work plan includes activities that enhance the four elements. States with\
  \ Voluntary Cleanup Program Memorandum of Agreement will not be prejudiced in funding\
  \ distributions if their work plan does not include tasks related to establishing\
  \ or enhancing the four elements.) (2) Funding for program development activities\
  \ to enhance the response program or the cleanup capacity of a state or Tribal response\
  \ program. (3) Funding for site-specific activities at eligible brownfields sites.\
  \ (4) Funding for environmental insurance mechanisms. (5) Funding to capitalize\
  \ brownfields cleanup RLFs. In addition, pursuant to Section 128(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III),\
  \ the program will allocate up to $1.5 M of CERCLA 104(k) funding for technical\
  \ assistance grants to small communities, Indian tribes, rural areas, or disadvantaged\
  \ areas to carry out activities described in Section 9604(k)(7)(A). The maximum\
  \ amount per technical assistance grant is $20,000."
