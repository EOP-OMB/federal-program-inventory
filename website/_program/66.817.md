objective: 'The primary objectives of EPA''s CERCLA Section 128(a) State and Tribal
  Response Program grants are to provide financial support to States, US Territories,
  and Tribal Nations to (1) establish or enhance the four statutory elements of an
  effective state or Tribal response program, as specified in CERCLA Section 128(a)(2),
  (2) maintain and update, at least annually, a public record of sites, pursuant to
  CERCLA § 128(b), that includes the name and location of sites at which response
  actions have been completed during the previous year and the name and location of
  sites at which response actions are planned to be addressed in the next year, and
  (3) conduct a limited number of brownfield site assessments or cleanups that will
  help establish or enhance the state or Tribal Nation’s response program. In addition,
  the CERCLA Section 128(a) grant program provides technical assistance funding for
  training and research to small communities, Indian tribes, rural communities, and
  disadvantaged areas as defined in CERCLA Section 128(a)(1)(B)(III)(iv).  In FY 2024,
  funding will be prioritized as follows: (1) Funding for program development activities
  to establish or enhance the four elements of a state or Tribal response program
  and to enable states and Tribes to comply with the public record requirement in
  Section 128(b)(1)(C), including activities related to institutional controls. (States
  and tribes that have established one or more of the four elements will not be prejudiced
  in funding distributions if their work plan includes activities that enhance the
  four elements. States with Voluntary Cleanup Program Memorandum of Agreement will
  not be prejudiced in funding distributions if their work plan does not include tasks
  related to establishing or enhancing the four elements.) (2) Funding for program
  development activities to enhance the response program or the cleanup capacity of
  a state or Tribal response program. (3) Funding for site-specific activities at
  eligible brownfields sites. (4) Funding for environmental insurance mechanisms.
  (5) Funding to capitalize brownfields cleanup RLFs. In addition, pursuant to Section
  128(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III), the program will allocate up to $1.5 M of CERCLA 104(k) funding
  for technical assistance grants to small communities, Indian tribes, rural areas,
  or disadvantaged areas to carry out activities described in Section 9604(k)(7)(A).
  The maximum amount per technical assistance grant is $20,000.'
