objective: "Puget Sound has been designated as one of 28 estuaries of National Significance\
  \ under \xA7320 of the Clean Water Act. The goal of the National Estuary Program\
  \ is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that would assure\
  \ protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced,\
  \ indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational\
  \ activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved\
  \ Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) is the Action Agenda. The\
  \ Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest\
  \ estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around\
  \ Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover\
  \ Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state,\
  \ local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate\
  \ actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing\
  \ the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments\
  \ include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the\
  \ fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by\
  \ reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution.\
  \ The Puget Sound Protection and Restoration: Tribal Implementation Assistance Program\
  \ is aimed at assisting the Indian Tribes of the greater Puget Sound basin in their\
  \ efforts to carry out work critically needed for Puget Sound protection and restoration.\
  \ This work includes activities identified in, or consistent with, the Action Agenda\
  \ such as efforts called for by established salmon recovery plans in the Puget Sound\
  \ basin. EPA has a trust responsibility to Federally recognized Indian Tribes. EPA\
  \ also recognizes that Federally recognized Indian Tribes in the greater Puget Sound\
  \ basin have a critical role in the protection and restoration of the ecosystem\
  \ and its resources. EPA seeks to provide financial assistance to these Tribes to\
  \ help them implement priority strategies and actions in or consistent with the\
  \ approved Clean Water Act \xA7320 CCMP for Puget Sound. Program has considered\
  \ relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program\
  \ consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order\
  \ 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest\
  \ public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and\
  \ services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps\
  \ combat the climate crisis using Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)\
  \ funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Tribal Capacity (non-competitive)\
  \ Capacity grants will be continued with funding in FFY2023 funding to support each\
  \ Tribe and Consortium to participate in the Puget Sound Management Conference,\
  \ depending on appropriations. Eligible tasks include representing tribal interests\
  \ in Management Conference forums and processes and other activities like identifying\
  \ limiting factors to habitat protection and salmon and shellfish recovery. Tribal\
  \ Implementation Lead (competitive) This grant was competed and will be funded with\
  \ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding for five years, to support eligible\
  \ subaward work which includes watershed and marine/estuary habitat restoration\
  \ projects. We anticipate that many of these projects will directly address salmon\
  \ and shellfish recovery"

- description: "For the first time in years, a local Tribe\u2019s ceremonial, and\
    \ subsistence fishery for coho salmon opened on the Elwha River. Many years of\
    \ the large Elwha dam removal effort, the long-term cooperative recovery monitoring\
    \ effort that ensued, and the process through which co-managers have determined\
    \ fishery status on the river have made this possible. For over a decade, the\
    \ Tribe has used EPA Puget Sound funds to support its engagement with multiple\
    \ partners in the intensive monitoring and restoration activities in the floodplain\
    \ and watershed during and following dam removal.  \n\nAnother Tribe celebrated\
    \ the success of a Dungeness River floodplain reconnection project, partially\
    \ funded by EPA Puget Sound Tribal Implementation Lead award. As described by\
    \ the JSKT Habitat Program Manager, \"Seven months ago, the Dungeness River east\
    \ floodplain at the Nature Center was a line of porta potties and a parking lot\
    \ behind a dike. Today, it's a reconnected, salmon-friendly floodplain and side\
    \ channel, conveying floodwaters peacefully down the valley. The bridge is wildly\
    \ popular with the public, and the old parking lots and county road are out of\
    \ harm's way.\" \n\n Another Tribe resurrected the ancient practice of clam gardening\
    \ that is in part funded by EPA\u2019s Puget Sound Tribal Capacity Grants.  Early\
    \ clam gardens date back as far as 3,500 years ago. Indigenous leaders from Washington\
    \ state Tribe and Canadian tribes and community members and biologists were brought\
    \ together to continue to construct a rock wall at the low tide line. EPA staff\
    \ joined the Tribal communities for the first rock wall construction session last\
    \ spring. Sediment filters through the holes between the rocks and extends the\
    \ shallow, gently sloping habitat favorable to native littleneck clams, sea cucumbers,\
    \ sea urchins, star fish and invertebrates that live on trapped seagrass and kelp.\
    \ A 2014 study in British Columbia found that clam biomass (clams per square foot)\
    \ was up to four times greater within the clam gardens.                      \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                                                            \
    \                              \n\nPuget Sound funds have allowed a Tribe to expand\
    \ the scope of their East Fork Nookachamps watershed assessment. As the project\
    \ has progressed, they have identified additional information needs for surface\
    \ water quality and groundwater. This information will serve a variety of purposes\
    \ now and into the future, including assessing baseline conditions, informing\
    \ project selection and design, predicting responses of management actions, and\
    \ long-term monitoring. \n\nOne Tribe has continued to make significant progress\
    \ advancing large scale floodplain/estuary restoration in the Stillaguamish watershed.\
    \   \n\nEducators are very open and excited about getting their students outside\
    \ and hands on with the Hatchery Tours and Iverson fieldtrips. Taking advantage\
    \ of land-based access sites has increased a Tribe\u2019s ability to collect data\
    \ for nearshore seining, due to difficult boat weather conditions.  Stillaguamish\
    \ has been successful at collecting over 180 samples and monitoring seal haul-out\
    \ locations and behavior. They learned that tagged seals are not moving up-river\
    \ and do not seem to have any spatial shifts in response to salmon migration windows.\
    \ Staff have been trained and have become proficient in using Survey123 and ArcGIS\
    \ online. Using these apps on a tablet or smart phones has substantially increased\
    \ the Tribe\u2019s capacity to complete invasive plant surveys. \n\nA pilot project\
    \ led by the Nisqually Tribe, with partners including Cedar Grove Compost, Washington\
    \ Department of Fish and Wildlife, NOAA, University of Washington, Long Live the\
    \ Kings, and Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission has been receiving funds through\
    \ the Puget Sound Tribal Implementation Lead.  The project site is in the Ohop\
    \ Creek valley, the third largest salmon-bearing tributary to the Nisqually River,\
    \ and where the Tribe has been conducting floodplain restoration for over 2 decades.\
    \ A biofiltration structure routes stormwater runoff from Highway 7 (a main corridor\
    \ for Mount Rainier traffic) through a 60% sand / 40% compost mixture prior to\
    \ discharge into Ohop valley wetlands. Preliminary measurements indicate removal\
    \ of 92% of 6PPD from this treatment process. The results of this work have implications\
    \ for stormwater quality treatment throughout Puget Sound and beyond."
