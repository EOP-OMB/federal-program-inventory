objective: "Puget Sound has been designated as one of 28 estuaries of National Significance\
  \ under \xA7320 of the Clean Water Act. The goal of the National Estuary Program\
  \ is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that would assure\
  \ protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced,\
  \ indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational\
  \ activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved\
  \ Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) is the Action Agenda. The\
  \ Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest\
  \ estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around\
  \ Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover\
  \ Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state,\
  \ local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate\
  \ actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing\
  \ the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments\
  \ include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the\
  \ fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by\
  \ reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution.\
  \ The Puget Sound Protection and Restoration: Tribal Implementation Assistance Program\
  \ is aimed at assisting the Indian Tribes of the greater Puget Sound basin in their\
  \ efforts to carry out work critically needed for Puget Sound protection and restoration.\
  \ This work includes activities identified in, or consistent with, the Action Agenda\
  \ such as efforts called for by established salmon recovery plans in the Puget Sound\
  \ basin. EPA has a trust responsibility to Federally recognized Indian Tribes. EPA\
  \ also recognizes that Federally recognized Indian Tribes in the greater Puget Sound\
  \ basin have a critical role in the protection and restoration of the ecosystem\
  \ and its resources. EPA seeks to provide financial assistance to these Tribes to\
  \ help them implement priority strategies and actions in or consistent with the\
  \ approved Clean Water Act \xA7320 CCMP for Puget Sound. Program has considered\
  \ relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program\
  \ consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order\
  \ 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest\
  \ public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and\
  \ services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps\
  \ combat the climate crisis using Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)\
  \ funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Tribal Capacity (non-competitive)\
  \ Capacity grants will be continued with funding in FFY2023 funding to support each\
  \ Tribe and Consortium to participate in the Puget Sound Management Conference,\
  \ depending on appropriations. Eligible tasks include representing tribal interests\
  \ in Management Conference forums and processes and other activities like identifying\
  \ limiting factors to habitat protection and salmon and shellfish recovery. Tribal\
  \ Implementation Lead (competitive) This grant was competed and will be funded with\
  \ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding for five years, to support eligible\
  \ subaward work which includes watershed and marine/estuary habitat restoration\
  \ projects. We anticipate that many of these projects will directly address salmon\
  \ and shellfish recovery"
