objective: "The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program exists to strengthen\
  \ and enhance the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\
  \ The CTP Program supports efforts to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience,\
  \ one of six main goals of the DHS 2020-2024 Strategic Plan. Additionally, the program\
  \ supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy, a supporting document to\
  \ Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-8) on National Preparedness.   The goals of\
  \ the CTP Program are to primarily support the mission and objectives of the NFIP\u2019\
  s Flood Hazard Mapping Program through FEMA\u2019s flood hazard identification and\
  \ risk assessment programs, including the Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning\
  \ (Risk MAP) initiative. The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that\
  \ increases public awareness of flood hazard risk and leads to action that reduces\
  \ flood risk to life and property. The CTP supports Risk MAP to develop flood hazard\
  \ data and maps for communities that have never had identified risks as well as\
  \ building on effective flood hazard data and flood insurance rate maps (FIRMS);\
  \ increase public awareness of risk and potential mitigation options to reduce risk\
  \ and better inform mitigation planning. Additional information about Risk MAP (including\
  \ goals, strategies, progress and success stories), can be found on FEMA\u2019s\
  \ website at at Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) | FEMA.gov."
