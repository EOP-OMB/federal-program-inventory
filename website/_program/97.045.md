objective: The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program exists to strengthen and
  enhance the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The CTP
  Program supports efforts to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience, one
  of six main goals of the DHS 2020-2024 Strategic Plan. Additionally, the program
  supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy, a supporting document to Presidential
  Policy Directive (PPD-8) on National Preparedness.   The goals of the CTP Program
  are to primarily support the mission and objectives of the NFIP’s Flood Hazard Mapping
  Program through FEMA’s flood hazard identification and risk assessment programs,
  including the Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) initiative. The vision
  for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness of flood
  hazard risk and leads to action that reduces flood risk to life and property. The
  CTP supports Risk MAP to develop flood hazard data and maps for communities that
  have never had identified risks as well as building on effective flood hazard data
  and flood insurance rate maps (FIRMS); increase public awareness of risk and potential
  mitigation options to reduce risk and better inform mitigation planning. Additional
  information about Risk MAP (including goals, strategies, progress and success stories),
  can be found on FEMA’s website at at Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk
  MAP) | FEMA.gov.

- description: The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program’s mission is to strengthen
    the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and support the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) mitigation objectives. The CTP
    Program leverages partnerships to deliver high-quality hazard identification and
    risk assessment products provide outreach support and empower communities to take
    action to reduce risk based on informed, multi hazard-based data and resources.
    This is in support of FEMA’s Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP)
    Program.  The performance measure identified in the FY22 NOFO is the Schedule
    Performance Index (SPI) and is one measure of Earned Value (EV). At the program
    level, tracking SPI ensures that as a portfolio, CTP projects are delivered on
    time and within budget.  As of the end of third quarter 2022, the aggregate SPI
    for all CTPs is 0.92 which is within tolerance of the target of 1.0 (+/-.08).  In
    ongoing efforts to support Risk MAP objectives, over the course of FY21, the CTPs
    developed flood hazard products to deliver Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps
    to 482 communities.  CTP partners also processed 180 Letters of Map Change, ensuring
    flood hazard data at a local level is current and accurate.
