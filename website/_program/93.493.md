  in HHS' Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, committee reports incorporated by
  reference into this Act, and other statutes mandating that HHS provide financial
  assistance awards to a designated recipient(s) for a particular program, project,
  or activity.  In some cases, Congressional Directives designate geographic areas.  Funding
  priorities are to issue these financial assistance awards to the designated recipients
  within statutory and regulatory requirements as quickly as possible.
