objective: The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) is a Federal formula
  grant program that provides financial assistance to States to reduce the number
  and severity of crashes and hazardous materials incidents involving commercial motor
  vehicles (CMV). The goal of the MCSAP is to reduce CMV-involved crashes, fatalities,
  and injuries through consistent, uniform, and effective CMV safety programs. Investing
  grant monies in appropriate safety programs will increase the likelihood that safety
  defects, driver deficiencies, and unsafe motor carrier practices will be detected
  and corrected before they become contributing factors to crashes.
