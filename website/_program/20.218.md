objective: The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) is a Federal formula
  grant program that provides financial assistance to States to reduce the number
  and severity of crashes and hazardous materials incidents involving commercial motor
  vehicles (CMV). The goal of the MCSAP is to reduce CMV-involved crashes, fatalities,
  and injuries through consistent, uniform, and effective CMV safety programs. Investing
  grant monies in appropriate safety programs will increase the likelihood that safety
  defects, driver deficiencies, and unsafe motor carrier practices will be detected
  and corrected before they become contributing factors to crashes.

- description: "Similar to 2015.\r\n Within FY 2016 the following national safety\
    \ elements were reached:\r\n\r\n•\t3,294,578 CMV safety inspections conducted;\r\
    \n•\t412,487 CMV traffic violations identified;\r\n•\t35,769 safety audits of\
    \ new motor carriers conducted;\r\n•\t6,269 compliance investigations of motor\
    \ carriers initiated, and\r\n•\t878,919 out of service safety violations identified.\
    \ \r\n\r\nThe above accomplishments were achieved by the 55 States and U.S. Territories\
    \ that were recipients of MCSAP funds within FY 2016. These efforts provided the\
    \ majority of national CMV and passenger carrier safety enforcement supported\
    \ through FMCSA. \r\n"

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2018: Within the current fiscal (FY 2018), over 2 million
    CMV inspections have been conducted under the auspices of this program, leading
    to safer highways with over 400,000 out of service (OOS) violations issued. This
    data also feeds FMCSA’s various safety data systems, allowing the Agency and its
    State partners to direct enforcement resources as necessary. The FMCSA has also
    launched its multi-year Commercial Vehicle Safety Plan (CVSP) project, allowing
    States to submit Plans (required for MCSAP eligibility) covering a three-year
    time span. This reduces administrative burdens on the State and FMCSA, while also
    enhancing the ability to effectively assess commercial vehicle safety impact over
    a specific time-period.'
  year: '2018'
- description: 'Fiscal Year 2019:  According to the FMCSA’s most recently published
    “Large Truck and Bus Statistics”, over 3 million CMV inspections have been conducted
    under the auspices of this program, leading to safer highways with over 600,000
    out of service (OOS) violations issued. This data also feeds FMCSA’s various safety
    data systems, allowing the Agency and its State partners to direct enforcement
    resources as necessary. The FMCSA has also launched its multi-year Commercial
    Vehicle Safety Plan (CVSP) project, allowing States to submit Plans (required

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2020:  According to the FMCSA’s most recently published
    “Large Truck and Bus Statistics”, approximately 3.4 million CMV inspections have
    been conducted under the auspices of this program, leading to safer highways with
    over 670,000 out of service (OOS) violations issued. This data also feeds FMCSA’s
    various safety data systems, allowing the Agency and its State partners to direct
    enforcement resources as necessary. The FMCSA finalized the launch of its multi-year
    Commercial Vehicle Safety Plan (CVSP) project, allowing States to submit Plans
    (required for MCSAP eligibility) covering a three-year time span. In addition,
    the FMCSA was able to complete critical updates to its MCSAP calculation formula
    (for use in FY 2021) and regulatory framework as required under the Fixing America’s
    Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.'

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2023: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs ACT (IIJA),
    also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), was passed early in FY22.
    Dollar amounts by State have been determined by the allocation formula. Information
    about the changes in the program can be found within the FMCSA Motor Carrier Safety
    Assistance Program Comprehensive Policy located on the FMCSA website https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/mission/grants/grantee-resources.
    FMCSA emphasizes the importance of safe commercial vehicle operation within highway
    construction zones, enforcement of traffic laws designed to mitigate driver behaviors
    associated with crashes (i.e. distracted driving), and the importance of detecting
    carriers operating in an out-of-service status as core parts of its FY 2023 MCSAP
    Grant. In addition, FMCSA placed significant emphasis on the improvement of commercial
    vehicle safety in-line with the strategies contained within the Department of
    Transportation’s National Roadway Safety Strategy (NRSS). This also includes renewed
    emphasis on areas where CMV and public safety intersect, such as combatting human
    trafficking and drug interdiction.'

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2025: Continuing to build upon the role played by the
    MCSAP National Program Elements established in 49 CFR § 350.203 and supported
    by IIJA/BIL funding, FMCSA is encouraging all MCSAP participants to review their
    jurisdiction’s crash statistics and engage in high-visibility efforts to combat
    the large number of CMV crashes and fatalities. MCSAP lead agencies should partner
    with other State, local safety departments, and educational research institutions
    where appropriate, to address CMV crashes. If the MCSAP lead agency is engaging
    in partnership efforts with other State, local agencies, or educational research
    institutions FMCSA asks they ensure it is accurately reflected within their Commercial
    Vehicle Safety Plan (CVSP).

    In response to IIJA/BIL requirements, the Crash Causal Factors Program (CCFP)
    is being established to carry out a comprehensive study to determine the causes
    of, and contributing factors to, crashes that involve a commercial motor vehicle.
    The CCFP is an evolutionary safety initiative moving from a crashworthiness to
    crash avoidance focus. Current data collections tend to be focused on the survivability
    of crashes, but the CCFP will provide critical insights into causal factors contributing
    to these crashes thereby enabling identification and development of appropriate
    countermeasures to reduce the occurrence of CMV crashes. While FMCSA is currently
    merging and analyzing available datasets (e.g., from the National Highway Traffic
    Safety Administration, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), FMCSA) to gain a
    more complete picture of crashes, no existing dataset adequately captures all
    important causal factors. The upcoming CCFP will fill this gap, allowing FMCSA
    to identify the key factors that contribute to CMV crashes.'
