objective: "The mission of the National Agricultural Statistics Agency (NASS) is to\
  \ provide timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to the U.S. agriculture\
  \ economy.  The statistical data provided by NASS is essential to the public and\
  \ private sectors for making effective policy, production, and marketing decisions\
  \ on a wide range of agricultural commodities.  The statistical data provided in\
  \ NASS studies and reports is necessary to maintain an objective source to ensure\
  \ commodity markets operate fairly and efficiently.  Every 5 years the Census of\
  \ Agriculture provides comprehensive national, State, and county data as well as\
  \ selected data for Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana\
  \ Islands.\r\n\r\nFormulate, develop, and administer programs for collecting and\
  \ publishing statistics related to agriculture, resources, and rural communities.\r\
  \n\r\nAssist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self sustaining,\
  \ repopulating and economically thriving.  \r\n\r\nEnsure our national forests and\
  \ private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate\
  \ change, while enhancing our water resources. To ensure that all of America's children\
  \ have access to safe, nutritious and balanced meals."

- description: " NASS is planning a Local Foods Special study to provide comprehensive\
    \ geographically represented farm-level data.  A Honey Bee Colonies report containing\
    \ loss information was released May 12, 2016.  NASS will publish state-level estimates\
    \ on number of colonies, colonies lost, colonies added, and colonies affected\
    \ by certain stressors.\r\n\r\n In December 2016, NASS published the results from\
    \ the Local Foods Survey.  This was the first publication of data looking into\
    \ the marketing channels utilized by producers to market their products locally.\
    \  Data provided insights into four marketing channels; direct to customer, direct\
    \ to retailer, direct to institutions, and sales to intermediate markets.  In\
    \ January 2016, NASS began a new survey to collect data to measure the cost of\
    \ honey bee pollination to crop producers.  The January survey collected data\
    \ for 2015, and a second survey in November collected data for 2016.  A publication\
    \ for both years was released in December 2016. In May 2016, the first Honey Bee\
    \ Colonies report was released, which included colony loss information along with\
    \ colony health stressors.  In April 2016, NASS released the Floriculture Crops,\
    \ 2015 Summary.  This release contains production, price, and whole value information\
    \ for the 2015 crop year."
