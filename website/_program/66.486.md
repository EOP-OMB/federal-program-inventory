objective: "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58, Nov. 15,\
  \ 2021), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), authorized a new\
  \ Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI grant program and appropriated $50\
  \ million for the program to support states, tribes, and territories in developing\
  \ and implementing UIC Class VI primacy programs. The objective of the grant program\
  \ is to support Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs under the\
  \ Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Class VI UIC programs ensure that sequestration\
  \ of carbon dioxide through Class VI injection wells is permitted in a manner that\
  \ is protective of underground sources of drinking water. The grant program provides\
  \ financial assistance to eligible states, territories, and tribes (States) to defray\
  \ expenses related to the establishment and operation of programs that permit Class\
  \ VI injection wells. The grants are for States that have already obtained primacy\
  \ for Class VI injection wells, as well as for States seeking to obtain Class VI\
  \ primacy. This Assistance listing considers relevant approaches to achieving the\
  \ intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements,\
  \ including priorities in E.O. 14052, Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands,\
  \ ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is\
  \ resilient and helps combat the climate crisis. Awardees will submit semi-annual\
  \ performance reports which will be used to measure successful implementation and\
  \ support evaluation.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA\u2019s funding\
  \ priority is to award funds to eligible states, territories, and tribes (States)\
  \ to develop and implement Class VI regulations and programs that allow for safe\
  \ injection of carbon dioxide for the purposes of geologic sequestration. EPA expects\
  \ States to develop workplans that prioritize those actions to result in a robust\
  \ and protective Class VI program in a timely manner."
