objective: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58, Nov. 15,
  2021), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), authorized a new Underground
  Injection Control (UIC) Class VI grant program and appropriated $50 million for
  the program to support states, tribes, and territories in developing and implementing
  UIC Class VI primacy programs. The objective of the grant program is to support
  Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs under the Safe Drinking Water
  Act (SDWA). Class VI UIC programs ensure that sequestration of carbon dioxide through
  Class VI injection wells is permitted in a manner that is protective of underground
  sources of drinking water. The grant program provides financial assistance to eligible
  states, territories, and tribes (States) to defray expenses related to the establishment
  and operation of programs that permit Class VI injection wells. The grants are for
  States that have already obtained primacy for Class VI injection wells, as well
  as for States seeking to obtain Class VI primacy. This Assistance listing considers
  relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program
  consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in E.O. 14052, Implementation
  of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably,
  create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America,
  and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis.
  Awardees will submit semi-annual performance reports which will be used to measure
  successful implementation and support evaluation.
