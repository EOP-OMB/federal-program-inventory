objective: "Objectives\nThe objectives of this program are: (1) to provide a stable\
  \ foundation from which to develop and maintain the nuclear forensics workforce;\
  \ (2) to provide an academic pathway from undergraduate to post-doctorate study\
  \ in disciplines directly relevant to nuclear forensics, including but not limited\
  \ to radiochemistry, geochemistry, nuclear physics, nuclear engineering, materials\
  \ science, and analytical chemistry; and (3) to increase a diverse and highly talented\
  \ cadre of new and emerging forensics experts who will fill specific expertise gaps\
  \ in the area of nuclear forensics, an important homeland security mission. These\
  \ objectives are aligned with the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act, P.L.111-140.\
  \ The following goals have been established to meet these objectives: \n\n\u2022\
  \tRecruit and produce a new generation of leaders and technical experts in a wide\
  \ range of fields relevant to nuclear forensics. \n\u2022\tEnhance the ability for\
  \ universities and the national and defense laboratories to work collaboratively\
  \ on advanced research in the nuclear forensics field.  \n\u2022\tImplement nuclear\
  \ forensics research awards to encourage undergraduate and graduate students to\
  \ perform forensic-related research in collaboration with academic professors and\
  \ researchers at the national laboratories. These awards promote research that advances\
  \ nuclear forensics methods, such as detection, characterization of materials, and\
  \ analysis of signatures, while encouraging universities to invest in these types\
  \ of programs, and feed students into post-doctoral/permanent staff positions in\
  \ nuclear forensics at the national laboratories or federal agencies."

- description: "Sponsorship of two Nuclear Forensics Research Awards that provide\
    \ academic support to undergraduate and graduate students and sponsor research\
    \ that furthers the body of knowledge in nuclear forensics.\n\nThe National Nuclear\
    \ Forensics Expertise Development Program continued sponsorship of two Nuclear\
    \ Forensics Research Awards (NFRAs).  The first NFRA developed sensitive mass\
    \ spectrometry instrumentation for ultra-high-resolution elemental and isotopic\
    \ analysis of nuclear materials.  This NFRA supported 1 graduate student and 2\
    \ undergraduate students, in addition to one faculty member.\n\nThe second NFRA\
    \ continued to collect and analyze \u03B3-\u03B3 coincidence spectra of fission\
    \ and actinide products resulting from fission-spectrum neutron induced fission\
    \ of 235U, 238U, and 239Pu.   Two graduate students and one undergraduate were\
    \ funded on the project and trained by university professors and laboratory scientists\
    \ in the field of material analysis for nuclear forensics. Additionally, the academic\
    \ partner hosted a summer research program for underrepresented students to get\
    \ hands-on experience with the tools used in radiation detection for nuclear security."
