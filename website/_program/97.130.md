objective: 'The objectives of this program are: (1) to provide a stable foundation
  from which to develop and maintain the nuclear forensics workforce; (2) to provide
  an academic pathway from undergraduate to post-doctorate study in disciplines directly
  relevant to nuclear forensics, including but not limited to radiochemistry, geochemistry,
  nuclear physics, nuclear engineering, materials science, and analytical chemistry;
  and (3) to increase a diverse and highly talented cadre of new and emerging forensics
  experts who will fill specific expertise gaps in the area of nuclear forensics,
  an important homeland security mission. These objectives are aligned with the Nuclear
  Forensics and Attribution Act, P.L.111-140, reaffirmed in Sections 1923(a)(12) and
  1926 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296 (codified as amended
  at 6 U.S.C. §§ 592(a)(12), 596). The following goals have been established to meet
  these objectives: • Recruit and produce a new generation of leaders and technical
  experts in a wide range of fields relevant to nuclear forensics. • Enhance the ability
  for universities and the national and defense laboratories to work collaboratively
  on advanced research in the nuclear forensics field. • Implement nuclear forensics
  research awards to encourage undergraduate and graduate students to perform forensic-related
  research in collaboration with academic professors and researchers at the national
  laboratories. These awards promote research that advances nuclear forensics methods,
  such as detection, characterization of materials, and analysis of signatures, while
  encouraging universities to invest in these types of programs, and feed students
  into post-doctoral/permanent staff positions in nuclear forensics at the national
  laboratories or federal agencies.'

    \ Program (NFGFP) to provide fellowships to graduate students pursuing graduate\
    \ degrees in nuclear, geochemical, and other disciplines directly relevant to\
    \ nuclear forensics.  This program aimed to develop the next generation of qualified\
    \ scientists to meet U.S. Government needs for nuclear forensics expertise and\
    \ to build a student career path in nuclear forensics.  Forty-five students participated\
    \ in the NFGFP, with 40 receiving doctoral degrees.  This program closed in Spring,\
    \ 2021.  \n\nNNFEDP established the Nuclear Forensice Research Awards program\
    \ in 2018.  Two NFRAs remain active through  FY 2021."

    sponsorship of two Nuclear Forensics  Research Awards (NFRAs).  The firse NFRA
    developed sensitive mass spectrometry instrumentation for ultra-high-resolution
    elemental and isotopic analysis of nuclear materials.  This NFRA supported 1 graduate
    student and 2 undergraduate students, in addition to one faculty memer.


    The second NFRA continued to collect and analyze y-y coincidence spectra of fission
    and actinide products resulting from fission-spectrum neutron induced fission
    of 235U, 238U, and 239Pu.  Two graduate students and one undergraduate were funded
    on the project and trained by university professors and laboratory scientists
    in the field of material analysis for nuclear forensics.  Additionally, the academic
