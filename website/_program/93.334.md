objective: 'The purpose of the listing is to implement public health actions through
  engagement of national partners and public health networks at national, state and
  local levels to apply public health strategies to promote cognitive health; address
  cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease; and support the needs of care
  partners (paid and unpaid persons providing care or assistance to someone with Alzheimer’s
  disease or related dementia). This will be accomplished through the provision of
  technical assistance and support in the following areas: 1) Using data and information
  to develop, examine, and deploy effective strategies, identify and address gaps
  in implementation, create and assess technical assistance tools, and monitor progress
  in achieving program goals; 2) Engaging in environmental approaches that promote
  inclusion of cognitive health, cognitive impairment and caregiving into community
  and workplace policies and plans; 3) Supporting health system strategies to improve
  early detection of cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease, and increasing
  awareness among health care providers about care partner health and role in care
  management; and 4) Facilitating the translation and dissemination of information
  and resources through public health networks.'
