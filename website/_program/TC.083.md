objective: Under the reference tax law baseline, the costs of acquiring tangible property
  and computer software would be depreciated using the Tax Codeâ€™s depreciation provisions.
  Under the normal tax baseline, depreciation allowances are estimates of economic
  depreciation. However, subject to investment limitations, the Tax Code allows up
  to $1 million (indexed for inflation) in qualifying investments in tangible property
  and certain computer software to be expensed rather than depreciated over time.
