objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest
  earned on State and local bonds issued to finance high-speed rail facilities and
  Government-owned airports, docks, wharves, and sport and convention facilities to
  be tax-exempt. These bonds are not subject to a volume cap.
