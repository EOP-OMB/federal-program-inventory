objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. Foster parents provide a home and care
  for children who are wards of the State, under contract with the State. Under current
  law, compensation received for this service is excluded from the gross incomes of
  foster parents; the expenses they incur are nondeductible.
