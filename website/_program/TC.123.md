objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a tax credit
  to parents who work or attend school and who have child and dependent care expenses.
  In taxable year 2023, expenditures up to a maximum $3,000 for one dependent and
  $6,000 for two or more dependents are eligible for a nonrefundable credit. The credit
  is equal to 35 percent of qualified expenditures for taxpayers with incomes of up
  to $15,000. The credit is reduced to a minimum of 20 percent by one percentage point
  for each $2,000 of income in excess of $15,000.
