objective: NHGRI supports the development of resources and technologies that will
  accelerate genome research and its application to human health and genomic medicine.
  A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal
  and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training
  and career development of investigators and the dissemination of genome information
  to the public and to health professionals.  The Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) program is used to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. The Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) program is used to foster scientific and technological innovation
  through cooperative research and development carried out between small business
  concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.
