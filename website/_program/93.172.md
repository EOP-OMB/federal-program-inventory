objective: NHGRI supports the development of resources and technologies that will
  accelerate genome research and its application to human health and genomic medicine.
  A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal
  and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training
  and career development of investigators and the dissemination of genome information
  to the public and to health professionals.  The Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) program is used to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. The Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) program is used to foster scientific and technological innovation
  through cooperative research and development carried out between small business
  concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.

- description: "The AnVIL Program serves as an interoperable resource for the research\
    \ community by co-locating data, storage, and computing infrastructure with commonly\
    \ used services and tools for analyzing and sharing data.\n\nSince its launch\
    \ in June 2019, the AnVIL Program has onboarded and publicly released several\
    \ high-value datasets (see the AnVIL Dataset Catalog), and deployed key genomic\
    \ analysis tools and packages such as Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Galaxy, Dockstore,\
    \ Bioconductor, and PharmCAT. The AnVIL platform was also integral to the analysis\
    \ of the first complete human genome of the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium effort.\
    \   A summary of the AnVIL Program's accomplishments includes: \n\nthe ingestion\
    \ of over 600,000 samples (4.56 Pb of data) into AnVIL  \n\nthe deployment of\
    \ Terra, for workspaces, interactive and batch computing \n\nthe deployment of\
    \ Gen3 within AnVIL \n\nrelease of Galaxy within AnVIL/Terra \n\nenhanced capabilities\
    \ for Dockstore \n\nenhanced capabilities for Jupyter notebooks \n\ndeployment\
    \ of RStudio available within Terra \n\nthe development and deployment of the\
    \ Bioconductor AnVIL packages \n\nestablishing the AnVIL Portal as a meta-portal\
    \ to each of the AnVIL components \n\nseveral successful outreach events \n\n\
    launched two cohorts of the AnVIL Cloud Credits Program \n\nlaunched a new Genomic\
    \ Data Science Community Network \n\ndeveloping an initial catalog of clinical\
    \ genomics tools \n\nlaunch of major efforts through the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability\
    \ (NCPI) program to increase usability across NIH funded cloud platforms \n\n\
    the piloting of the Data Use Oversight System (DUOS) \n\negress-free Release of\
    \ the GTEx V8 Protected Data \n\nThe AnVIL team continues to engage the genomics\
    \ research communities by presenting posters and holding workshops. For example,\
    \ the AnVIL team has presented at the Bioinformatics Community Conference, the\
    \ American Society of Human Genetics meeting, and has hosted a webinar at the\
    \ 2021 Bioconductor Virtual Conference. In 2021 the AnVIL team launched the AnVIL\
    \ Cloud Credits Program (AC2) which invited genomic researchers to submit proposals\
    \ that use the AnVIL platform for large-scale data analysis with cloud computing\
    \ credits supported by the NIH STRIDES program.  Six investigators received awards\
    \ from the AC2 program to use AnVIL as their analysis platform. After the success\
    \ of AC2, the program was expanded in 2022 with 13 additional cloud credit awardees.\
    \  \n\nThe AnVIL Program is also committed to addressing disparities in equitable\
    \ access to resources for performing large scale genomic based analysis. In March\
    \ 2021, the AnVIL team helped organize the first meeting of the Genomic Data Science\
    \ Community Data Network (GDSCN). This meeting brought together over 40 researchers\
    \ from a diverse spectrum of institutions. The focus of the GDSCN is to build\
    \ partnerships and develop genomic data science curricula for undergraduate students.\
    \ The AnVIL team also partnered with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy and\
    \ Howard University\u2019s Virtual Applied Data Science Training Institute (VADSTI)\
    \ to develop a free eight-week virtual training series. VADSTI aims to attract\
    \ and engage underrepresented students and researchers interested in applying\
    \ data science applications to biomedical, clinical, and genomic research, with\
    \ a focus on diseases common to minority populations.  The training sessions covered\
    \ foundational analytic skills needed for research using big data and included\
    \ an AnVIL team led session on how to use the cloud to make biomedical data science\
    \ discoveries. \n\n The AnVIL Program is a key component of the emerging ecosystem\
    \ of data resources at NIH and is expected to collaborate and integrate with other\
    \ genomic data resources through the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,\
    \ Interoperable, Reusable) principles, as their specifications emerge from the\
    \ genomics community. The AnVIL team has collaborated with the Researcher Auth\
    \ Service (RAS) Initiative to facilitate access to NIH\u2019s controlled data\
    \ assets and repositories in a consistent manner.  \n\nThe AnVIL Program is committed\
    \ to contributing to and ensuring interoperability with Fast Healthcare Interoperability\
    \ Resources (FHIR) to help address the needs of the clinical genomic research\
    \ community. The FHIR standard describes data formats and elements (known as \"\
    resources\") and an API for exchanging electronic health records (EHR). In support\
    \ of this need, Bioconductor and Galaxy have leveraged FHIR for research purposes.\
    \ Furthermore, the open-source AnVIL-FHIR python package (pyAnVIL) was initiated\
    \ on github, and over the course of the past year, has been substantially expanded\
    \ and enhanced."
