objective: To provide communities with critical resources that help them forge partnerships
  across agencies and disciplines to respond effectively to violent crimes against
  women.  OVW's Technical Assistance Program was created to provide grantees with
  the expertise and support they need to develop and implement successful local projects,
  increase victim safety, and bolster offender accountability. Grantees participate
  in educational initiatives, conferences, peer-to- peer consultations, and targeted
  assistance that allow them to learn from experts and one another about how to overcome
  obstacles and incorporate promising practices in their efforts to address violence
  against women.  In addition, the Technical Assistance Program focuses on building
  the capacity of national criminal justice and victim advocacy organizations to effectively
  address violent crimes against women and examine issues of special interest to OVW
  and its constituents.
