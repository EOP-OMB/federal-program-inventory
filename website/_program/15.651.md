objective: 'The Central Africa Regional Program supports projects in Central Africa
  that strengthen capacity, target key threats to wildlife and their habitats, and
  build a better evidence base for conservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
  (USFWS) prioritizes strengthening capacity for wildlife protection, including the
  professionalization of park staff, protected species management, and wildlife law
  enforcement. USFWS provides tools and technologies for measuring, evaluating, and
  improving the effectiveness of site-based protection and wildlife conservation.
  The success of USFWS efforts depends on building the capacity of Central African
  governments and field partners to professionally manage and protect their national
  resources.  USFWS works closely with governments, other U.S. agencies, international
  donors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), wildlife colleges, communities, and
  a range of other partners to ensure a strategic, results-based approach to wildlife
  stewardship in Central Africa. Through a competitive process, USFWS provides support
  where it is needed most and can be applied effectively. Long-term goals of support
  include:  (1) promoting landscape connectivity in Central Africa’s most important
  wildlife strongholds, (2) protecting parks by supporting the front lines of protected
  area management and capacity development, (3) addressing regional threats to wildlife,
  and (4) conserving critical wildlife populations.'
