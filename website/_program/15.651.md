objective: "The Central Africa Regional Program supports projects in Central Africa\
  \ that strengthen capacity, target key threats to wildlife and their habitats, and\
  \ build a better evidence base for conservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\
  \ (USFWS) prioritizes strengthening capacity for wildlife protection, including\
  \ the professionalization of park staff, protected species management, and wildlife\
  \ law enforcement. USFWS provides tools and technologies for measuring, evaluating,\
  \ and improving the effectiveness of site-based protection and wildlife conservation.\
  \ The success of USFWS efforts depends on building the capacity of Central African\
  \ governments and field partners to professionally manage and protect their national\
  \ resources.  USFWS works closely with governments, other U.S. agencies, international\
  \ donors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), wildlife colleges, communities,\
  \ and a range of other partners to ensure a strategic, results-based approach to\
  \ wildlife stewardship in Central Africa. Through a competitive process, USFWS provides\
  \ support where it is needed most and can be applied effectively. Long-term goals\
  \ of support include:  (1) promoting landscape connectivity in Central Africa\u2019\
  s most important wildlife strongholds, (2) protecting parks by supporting the front\
  \ lines of protected area management and capacity development, (3) addressing regional\
  \ threats to wildlife, and (4) conserving critical wildlife populations."
