objective: 'To reduce cancer risk, incidence, morbidity, and mortality and enhance
  quality of life in cancer survivors through an orderly sequence from research on
  interventions and their impact in defined populations to the broad, systematic application
  of the research results through dissemination and diffusion strategies. Primary
  emphasis is on the inclusion of cancer prevention and control intervention(s) in
  any proposed study. Cancer Prevention and Cancer Control research studies are classified
  into one of five phases: (1) Hypothesis development; (2) methods development and
  testing; (3) controlled intervention trials to establish cause-and-effect relationships;
  (4) research in defined populations; and (5) demonstration and implementation studies.
  Primary interests are in research on cancer control interventions in Phases 2 through
  5, and on cancer prevention research in all phases. Cancer Prevention and Control
  programs include those in the following areas: (1) cancer epidemiology; (2) cancer
  communications; (3) nutrition, diet, and physical activity; (4) screening and early
  detection in health care delivery; (5) biobehavioral mechanisms; (6) tobacco control;
  (7) health disparities research; (8) supportive care and survivorship; (9) health
  services and outcomes research; and (10) surveillance research. Cancer Control uses
  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer
  (STTR) Programs to engage domestic small business concerns in federal research and
  development that has potential for commercialization. The goals of the SBIR & STTR
  Programs are to stimulate technological innovation, increase private-sector commercialization
  of federal research and development, increase small business participation in federally
  funded research and development, and foster participation by socially and economically
  disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in
  technological innovation.  The STTR Program requires the small business concern
  to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II of the
  program.'
