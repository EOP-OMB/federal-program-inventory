    quality standards. All 56 states, territories, and the District of Columbia accepted
    their allocated share of multipurpose grant funding.Tribes are using multipurpose
    funding to complement and enhance implementation of their water quality standards
    programs in conjunction with existing Clean Water Act Section 106 activities.
