objective: 'The Regional Public Health Training Center program improves the Nation''s
  public health system by strengthening the technical, scientific, managerial and
  leadership competencies of the current and future public health workforce through
  the provision of education, training and consultation services. The Regional PHTC
  Programs together comprise a national program that serves all 50 states, the District
  of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the six U.S. Pacific Jurisdictions.
  Ten regions are funded to ensure that the U.S. and its jurisdictions all have access
  to public health workforce education and training. The work of the Regional PHTCs
  will be accomplished through the provision of tailored training and technical assistance
  (TA) through collaborative community-based projects. Training curricula will provide
  skill-based, interactive instruction and quality education using multiple modalities
  (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, distance-based, bi-directional video, and in-person),
  underscoring the current eight cross-cutting core public health competency domains
  in the primary areas of (1) analytical/assessment, (2) policy development/ program
  planning, (3) communication skills, (4) cultural competency, (5) community dimension
  of practice, (6) public health sciences, (7) financial planning and management and,
  (8) leadership and systems thinking.  Each Regional PHTC will develop training in
  at least three primary areas listed above and may develop trainings in the sub competencies
  and beyond based on local health needs assessments. Regional PHTCs seek to develop
  current and future public health leaders though Leadership Institutes. Moreover,
  the program aims to establish and enhance collaborative partnerships among state
  and local health departments, primary care providers, and related organizations
  (to include non-traditional partners) as they work together to address critical
  local public health needs.


  The Community Health Woker Training Program (CHWTP) expands the public health workforce
  through the training of new Community Health Workers (CHWs) and health support workers
  and to extend the knowledge and skills of current CHWs and other health support
  workers. Through this program, HRSA plans to train 13,000 new and current CHWs and
  other health support workers to support essential public health services and to
  focus on experiential training and employment through registered apprenticeships
  and job placements. The CHWTP aims to increase access to care, improve public health
  emergency response, and address the public health needs of underserved communities.
  Individuals trained through the program will acquire knowledge, skills, and expertise
  to respond to public health needs and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19
  pandemic, in underserved communities through a network of partnerships.


  The Public Health Scholarship Program (PHSP) to strengthens the public health workforce
  by providing support to organizations to develop scholarship programs that incentivize
  individuals to pursue training and careers in public health. Through the PHSP, scholarship
  recipients will gain the requisite knowledge and skills necessary to prevent, prepare
  for, and respond to recovery activities related to COVID–19, as well as other public
  health emergencies.  This program will provide funds to State or local governments,
  including state, local, territorial or tribal public health departments, health
  professions schools, academic health centers, and public or private nonprofit entities
  with a public health focus. Award recipients will provide scholarships to individuals,
  including grant recipient employees, receiving public health training in professional,
  graduate, degree, and/or certificate programs.'
