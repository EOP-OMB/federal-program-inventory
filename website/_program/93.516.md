objective: "The Regional Public Health Training Center program improves the Nation's\
  \ public health system by strengthening the technical, scientific, managerial and\
  \ leadership competencies of the current and future public health workforce through\
  \ the provision of education, training and consultation services. The Regional PHTC\
  \ Programs together comprise a national program that serves all 50 states, the District\
  \ of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the six U.S. Pacific Jurisdictions.\
  \ Ten regions are funded to ensure that the U.S. and its jurisdictions all have\
  \ access to public health workforce education and training. The work of the Regional\
  \ PHTCs will be accomplished through the provision of tailored training and technical\
  \ assistance (TA) through collaborative community-based projects. Training curricula\
  \ will provide skill-based, interactive instruction and quality education using\
  \ multiple modalities (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, distance-based, bi-directional\
  \ video, and in-person), underscoring the current eight cross-cutting core public\
  \ health competency domains in the primary areas of (1) analytical/assessment, (2)\
  \ policy development/ program planning, (3) communication skills, (4) cultural competency,\
  \ (5) community dimension of practice, (6) public health sciences, (7) financial\
  \ planning and management and, (8) leadership and systems thinking.  Each Regional\
  \ PHTC will develop training in at least three primary areas listed above and may\
  \ develop trainings in the sub competencies and beyond based on local health needs\
  \ assessments. Regional PHTCs seek to develop current and future public health leaders\
  \ though Leadership Institutes. Moreover, the program aims to establish and enhance\
  \ collaborative partnerships among state and local health departments, primary care\
  \ providers, and related organizations (to include non-traditional partners) as\
  \ they work together to address critical local public health needs.\n\nThe Community\
  \ Health Woker Training Program (CHWTP) expands the public health workforce through\
  \ the training of new Community Health Workers (CHWs) and health support workers\
  \ and to extend the knowledge and skills of current CHWs and other health support\
  \ workers. Through this program, HRSA plans to train 13,000 new and current CHWs\
  \ and other health support workers to support essential public health services and\
  \ to focus on experiential training and employment through registered apprenticeships\
  \ and job placements. The CHWTP aims to increase access to care, improve public\
  \ health emergency response, and address the public health needs of underserved\
  \ communities. Individuals trained through the program will acquire knowledge, skills,\
  \ and expertise to respond to public health needs and public health emergencies,\
  \ such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in underserved communities through a network of\
  \ partnerships.\n\nThe Public Health Scholarship Program (PHSP) to strengthens the\
  \ public health workforce by providing support to organizations to develop scholarship\
  \ programs that incentivize individuals to pursue training and careers in public\
  \ health. Through the PHSP, scholarship recipients will gain the requisite knowledge\
  \ and skills necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to recovery activities\
  \ related to COVID\u201319, as well as other public health emergencies.  This program\
  \ will provide funds to State or local governments, including state, local, territorial\
  \ or tribal public health departments, health professions schools, academic health\
  \ centers, and public or private nonprofit entities with a public health focus.\
  \ Award recipients will provide scholarships to individuals, including grant recipient\
  \ employees, receiving public health training in professional, graduate, degree,\
  \ and/or certificate programs."
