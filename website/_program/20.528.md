- description: "The State Safety Oversight Program significantly \nstrengthens an\
    \ SSO Agency\u2019s (SSOA) authority to investigate accidents and oversee a rail\
    \ transit agency\u2019s (RTA). \n\nFTA has the authority to review and approve\
    \ each State\u2019s SSO program and take enforcement  actions against those States\
    \ with non-existent or non-compliant safety oversight programs. As a result, the\
    \ Nation's Rail Transit Agencies are safer than in previous years."

- description: "FTA issued special directives to all State Safety Oversight Agencies\
    \ (SSOA), the agencies that oversee safety at rail transit systems, to develop\
    \ and implement a risk-based inspection program in accordance with changes to\
    \ FTA\u2019s Public Transportation Safety Program as required by the Bipartisan\
    \ Infrastructure Law. A risk-based inspection program uses qualitative and quantitative\
    \ data analysis to inform inspection activities and is designed to prioritize\
    \ safety concerns and hazards associated with the highest levels of risk. Learn\
    \ more about risk-based inspection programs. A risk-based inspection program uses\
    \ qualitative and quantitative data analysis to identify safety concerns and hazards\
    \ associated with the highest levels of risk. Inspectors can then use data to\
    \ inform their inspection practices, with the goal improving safety by prioritizing\
    \ and addressing hazards.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law identified actions\
    \ that FTA, SSOAs, and rail transit agencies (RTAs) must take to implement effective\
    \ risk-based inspection programs."
