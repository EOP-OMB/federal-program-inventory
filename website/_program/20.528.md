- description: 'On March 16, 2016 FTA published a Final Rule for the SSO program that
    significantly strengthens state safety oversight and enforcement authority to
    prevent and mitigate accidents and incidents on rail transit systems. It applies
    to States where a rail transit system operates, and carries out several explicit
    Federal statutory requirements, including that a State must submit its State Safety
    Oversight (SSO) program to FTA for certification and that the designated SSO Agency
    must have financial and legal independence from the rail transit agencies it oversees.
    In addition, the final rule requires that a State must ensure that the SSO Agency
    adopts and enforces relevant Federal and state safety laws, has investigatory
    authority, and has appropriate financial and human resources for the number, size
    and complexity of the rail transit systems within its jurisdiction.  Furthermore,
    SSO Agency personnel responsible for performing safety oversight activities must
    have proper training and certification. Within three years of the effective date
    of this final rule, States with an operating rail transit system must have a SSO
    program certified by FTA.  FTA has already certified two of the affected 30 States
    as being compliant: California and Massachusetts. Most of the remaining 28 States
    have also already taken some actions toward compliance with these critical safety
    requirements. On March 16, 2016 FTA published a Final Rule for the SSO program
    that significantly strengthens state safety oversight and enforcement authority
    to prevent and mitigate accidents and incidents on rail transit systems. It applies
    to States where a rail transit system operates, and carries out several explicit
    Federal statutory requirements, including that a State must submit its State Safety
    Oversight (SSO) program to FTA for certification and that the designated SSO Agency

- description: 'Funding for this program will continue. The SSO final rule was published
    March 16, 2016 and the States have three years to comply with 49 CFR 674. The
    State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program is not a typical federal assistance project,
    but a program that requires routine monitoring of 30 States by the FTA to review,
    approve, and certify programmatic aspects, as well as provide technical assistance,
    as needed. '

- description: "By 2020 all States certified and met the April 15, 2019 deadline regarding\
    \ changes in Federal public transportation law requiring states to strengthen\
    \ the oversight of rail transit systems.  It applied to all federally funded rail\
    \ fixed guideway public transportation systems such as heavy rail, light rail,\
    \ monorail, and streetcar systems. \n\n To achieve FTA certification, a SSO Program\
    \ had to meet several federal statutory requirements, including establishing a\
    \ SSO agency that is financially and legally independent from the rail transit\
    \ agencies it oversees. In addition, a state had to ensure that its SSO agency\
    \ adopts and enforces relevant federal and state safety laws, has investigatory\
    \ authority, and has appropriate financial and human resources for the number,\
    \ size and complexity of the rail transit systems within the state’s jurisdiction.\
    \ Furthermore, SSO agency personnel responsible for performing safety oversight\
    \ activities had to be appropriately trained.  If a state had failed to meet the\
    \ deadline, FTA would have been prohibited by law from awarding any new federal\
    \ transit funds to transit agencies within the state until certification was achieved.\

- description: "The State Safety Oversight Program significantly \nstrengthens an\
    \ SSO Agency’s (SSOA) authority to investigate accidents and oversee a rail transit\
    \ agency’s (RTA). \n\nFTA has the authority to review and approve each State’s\
    \ SSO program and take enforcement  actions against those States with non-existent\
    \ or non-compliant safety oversight programs. As a result, the Nation's Rail Transit\
    \ Agencies are safer than in previous years."
  year: '2022'
- description: 'FTA issued special directives to all State Safety Oversight Agencies
    (SSOA), the agencies that oversee safety at rail transit systems, to develop and
    implement a risk-based inspection program in accordance with changes to FTA’s
    Public Transportation Safety Program as required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law. A risk-based inspection program uses qualitative and quantitative data analysis
    to inform inspection activities and is designed to prioritize safety concerns
    and hazards associated with the highest levels of risk. Learn more about risk-based
    inspection programs. A risk-based inspection program uses qualitative and quantitative
    data analysis to identify safety concerns and hazards associated with the highest
    levels of risk. Inspectors can then use data to inform their inspection practices,
    with the goal improving safety by prioritizing and addressing hazards.


    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law identified actions that FTA, SSOAs, and rail
    transit agencies (RTAs) must take to implement effective risk-based inspection
    programs.'
