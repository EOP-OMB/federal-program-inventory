results:
- description: 'As of September 30, 2022, 30 states reported spending 100 percent
    of their HAVA Requirements Payment funds (including interest) and another 17 states
    reported spending 90% or more of their funds and interest. States reported cumulative
    expenditures of $2,770,043,030 or 95% of total funds. The states with the highest
    percentages remaining include states that had replaced

    a large portion of their voting equipment immediately prior to receiving HAVA
    funds. Those states expect to replace voting equipment in the near future, and
    their balance of unexpended funds will decrease significantly.'
