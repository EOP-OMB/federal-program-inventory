objective: Funds will support a comprehensive research plan to compile, categorize,
  analyze, and publicize methodologically sound information on People’s Republic of
  China (PRC) international economic influence. The information will allow developing
  countries, including in South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific, to assess more
  accurately the risks associated with PRC technology acquisition and deployment plans,
  and help them build alliances to combat unfair economic practices. This project
  will fill persistent knowledge gaps and produce a high-resolution map of all major
  PRC Government industrial and advanced technology initiatives, using proven research
  methods to identify detailed information on priorities, implementing institutions,
  and policy tools. It will provide a detailed understanding of how high-level, high-profile
  PRC policy initiatives translate into discrete actions and support for PRC industry
  throughout all levels of government, particularly as they interface with PRC private
  and state-owned firms. The project will significantly expand global understanding
  of PRC digital investments, Military-Civil Fusion, and other technology innovation
  efforts. The implementing partner will provide this information through outreach
  to targeted countries. Activities may include conferences for ESF-eligible countries
  globally that convene the research teams to share, evaluate and cross validate results.
  The program’s research outputs will be publicly available and include information
  detailing PRC cyber, ICT, and emerging technology plans and intentions, easily accessible
  by governments, academics, journalists, and NGOs.
