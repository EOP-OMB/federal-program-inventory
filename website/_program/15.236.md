objective: "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and its cooperative government and\
  \ nongovernmental conservation partners, mitigate hazards to protect public health\
  \ and safety, and restore watersheds for resources, recreation, fish, wildlife and\
  \ domestic animals, and return lands to productive uses including, but not limited\
  \ to, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and preservation of historical/cultural\
  \ resources. Extractive industry activities of the past, including both underground\
  \ and surface mining and oil and gas drilling, have left degraded watersheds on\
  \ public lands throughout (State). Unreclaimed sites pose an environmental threat\
  \ to groundwater, surface water and soil as well as create a risk to the health\
  \ and safety of public land users. \nMitigation measures are implemented through\
  \ core programs such as: 1).Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program, which addresses physical\
  \ safety hazards and water quality through restoration of abandoned hardrock mines.\
  \ 2). Orphan Well Program, which remediates oil and gas wells improperly abandoned,\
  \ and seeks to plug them in accordance with state regulations and rules; 3). Educational\
  \ outreach about the potential dangers posed to the public and recreationists from\
  \ AML and orphaned well sites.\nThis program continues to advance the Department\
  \ of the Interior\u2019s priorities to address the climate crisis, restore balance\
  \ on public lands and waters, advance environmental justice, and invest in a clean\
  \ energy future. The BLM\u2019s AML Program and Orphan Well Project support these\
  \ priorities by focusing efforts in the following areas: \u202F1) environmental\
  \ compliance, and the identification, inventory, cleanup and remediation of legacy\
  \ contaminated sites and features; 2) immediate response to releases of hazardous\
  \ substances, wastes and materials onto public lands; 3) mitigation of priority\
  \ AML and Orphan Well contaminated and physical safety sites and features; 4) improving\
  \ all BLM environmental programs via an environmental management system including\
  \ environmental audits;\u202F and, 5) providing program training and awareness.\
  \ Through these focused efforts, BLM will also strengthen Environmental Justice\
  \ (EJ) actions to ensure fair treatment and meaningful involvement of EJ and disadvantaged\
  \ communities/stakeholders during the CERCLA and RCRA planning and cleanup processes.\
  \ The AML Program and Orphan Well Project will contribute to the conversation and\
  \ restoration of approximately 30% of our lands and waters by the year 2030 by reducing\
  \ the contamination levels. Additionally, this will help ensure that public land\
  \ users are not at risk from the dangers of legacy mining and oil and gas activities.\
  \ This program will support projects funded under the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration and anticipate\
  \ to receive additional funding under Title VII - Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation."
