objective: 'The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and its cooperative government and

  nongovernmental conservation partners, mitigate hazards to protect public

  health and safety, restore watersheds for resources, recreation, fish, wildlife
  and

  domestic animals, and return lands to productive uses including, but not limited

  to, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and preservation of

  historical/cultural resources. Extractive industry and disposal activities of the

  past, including both underground and surface mining, have left degraded

  watersheds on public lands throughout the western United States. Unreclaimed

  sites pose an environmental threat to groundwater, surface water and soil as

  well as create a risk to the health and safety of public land users. Mitigation

  measures are implemented through core programs such as: !). Abandoned Mine

  Lands (AML) program, which addresses physical safety hazards and water

  quality through restoration of abandoned hard rock mines. and 2). Educational

  outreach about the potential dangers posed to the public and recreationists

  from AML sites. This program continues to advance the Department of the

  Interior''s priorities to address the climate crisis, restore balance on public
  lands

  and waters, advance environmental justice, and invest in a clean energy future.

  The BLM''s AML Program supports these priorities by focusing efforts in the

  following areas: 1) environmental compliance; 2) the identification, inventory,

  and remediation of legacy contaminated features and sites; 3) immediate

  response to releases of hazardous substances, wastes and materials onto public

  lands; 3) mitigation of priority AML contaminated and physical safety sites and

  features; and, 4) providing program training and awareness. Through these

  focused efforts, BLM will also strengthen Environmental Justice (EJ) actions to

  ensure fair treatment and meaningful involvement of EJ and disadvantaged

  communities/stakeholders during the CERCLA , NEPA and RCRA planning and

  cleanup processes. The AML Program will contribute to the conservation and

  restoration of approximately 30% of our lands and waters by the year 2030.

  Additionally, this will help ensure that public land users are not at risk from
  the

  dangers of legacy mining activities. This program will support projects funded

  under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b)

  Ecosystem Restoration and anticipate receiving additional funding under Title

  VII - Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation.'

- description: "In FY2020, the BLM 1644 Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program successfully\
    \ utilized grants and agreements with state agencies, NGOs, other Federal Agencies,\
    \ etc., to complete the following types of AML program-specific work: AML physical\
    \ safety site inventory; AML physical safety closure; AML environmental cleanup;\
    \ Threatened & Endangered species surveys; Cultural surveys and Wildlife and Bat\
    \ surveys and counts Studies.\n\nBecause of the remoteness of most BLM AML sites,\
    \ work is often combined.  For instance, the survey work for plants and wildlife\
    \ can be done at the same time. \n\nAccomplishments for FY2020 for AML program-specific\
    \ work were as follows: \nWildlife, Bat, and Threatened & Endangered Species Surveys\
    \ / 145; AML site surveys / 365; AML site studies / 12\nAML physical safety closures\
