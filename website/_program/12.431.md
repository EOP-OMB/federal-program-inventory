objective: To support basic research, and enhance fundamental knowledge in the chemical,
  life, physical, engineering, materials, mechanical, computing, information, network,
  mathematical, earth, and social sciences, related to long-term national security
  needs. The insights gained from this research hold significant promise for advancing
  Army programs and operations.

- description: The mission of the programs funded against CFDA 12.431 is  to discover,
    innovate, and transition science and technology to ensure dominant strategic land
    power, now and into the future. To execute this mission, the Army leverages the
    substantial intellectual resource represented by the global academic scientific
    research community. Formation of a collaborative and transparent relationship
    with this community, with industry, and with small business through the Open Campus
    initiative offers the prospect for enhanced discovery and innovation, and effective
    execution of basic and applied research programs in a variety of technical focus
    areas of high Army interest.
  year: '2019'
- description: The Army Research Laboratory's (ARL), through its Army Research Office
    (ARO) extramural research program, drives cutting-edge foundational research and
    disruptive scientific discoveries that results in innovations that have significant
    impact on enabling new and improved Army operational capabilities and related
    technologies. ARO competitively selects and funds basic research proposals from
    educational institutions, nonprofit organizations and private industry to increase
    fundamental knowledge and understanding in the chemical, life, physical, engineering,
    materials, mechanical, computing, information, network, mathematical, earth, and
    social sciences, related to long-term national security needs. The research funded
    is conducted at 250 universities across the country and around the world with
    more than 1,100 individual researchers. The results of these research efforts
    are transitioned to the Army research and development community, industry, or
    academia for future technological superiority of our Soldiers, Army and nation.
    The research awarded under the grants and cooperative agreements represents the
    most long-range Army view, with system applications often 20-30 years away.
