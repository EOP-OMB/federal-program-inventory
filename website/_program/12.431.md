- description: The Army Research Office (ARO) drives cutting-edge and disruptive scientific
    discoveries that will enable crucial future Army technologies and capabilities
    through high-risk, high pay-off research opportunities.  ARO competitively select
    and fund basic research proposals from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations
    and private industry to increase fundamental knowledge and understanding in the
    chemical, life, physical, engineering, materials, mechanical, computing, information,
    network, mathematical, earth, and social sciences, related to long-term national
    security needs.  The research funded is conducted at 250 universities across the
    country and around the world with more than 1,100 individual researchers.   The
    results of these research efforts are transitioned to the Army research and development
    community, industry, or academia for future technological superiority of our Soldiers,
    Army and nation. The research awarded under the grants and cooperative agreements
    represents the most long-range Army view, with system applications often 20-30
    years away.
