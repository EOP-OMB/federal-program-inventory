- description: The mission of the programs funded against CFDA 12.431 is  to discover,
    innovate, and transition science and technology to ensure dominant strategic land
    power, now and into the future. To execute this mission, the Army leverages the
    substantial intellectual resource represented by the global academic scientific
    research community. Formation of a collaborative and transparent relationship
    with this community, with industry, and with small business through the Open Campus
    initiative offers the prospect for enhanced discovery and innovation, and effective
    execution of basic and applied research programs in a variety of technical focus
    areas of high Army interest.

- description: The Army Research Office (ARO) drives cutting-edge and disruptive scientific
    discoveries that will enable crucial future Army technologies and capabilities
    through high-risk, high pay-off research opportunities.  ARO competitively select
    and fund basic research proposals from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations
    and private industry to increase fundamental knowledge and understanding in the
    chemical, life, physical, engineering, materials, mechanical, computing, information,
    network, mathematical, earth, and social sciences, related to long-term national
    security needs.  The research funded is conducted at 250 universities across the
    country and around the world with more than 1,100 individual researchers.   The
    results of these research efforts are transitioned to the Army research and development
    community, industry, or academia for future technological superiority of our Soldiers,
    Army and nation. The research awarded under the grants and cooperative agreements
    represents the most long-range Army view, with system applications often 20-30
    years away.
