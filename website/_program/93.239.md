objective: 'The goals of this listing are to improve the effectiveness of public policies
  that reduce poverty, inequality, and their consequences, promote economic mobility
  and equity, and further develop knowledge of the structural causes of poverty, inequality,
  and economic insecurity. To that end, the National Research Center on Poverty and
  Economic Mobility will: (1) develop a fellowship program that will place researchers
  on site at HHS to work with federal policy, research, and/or program offices, (2)
  administer a grant program that will make multiple awards to policy researchers
  to conduct research and analysis to answer high-priority questions related to equity,
  inclusion, diversity, and access in economic mobility and human services policy
  and programs, and (3) collaborate with HHS to disseminate actionable findings which
  are relevant to primarily federal policy and research communities through co-hosted
  events.'
