objective: A credit is provided equal to 15 percent of the taxpayerâ€™s costs for enhanced
  oil recovery on U.S. projects. If the reference price of oil for the previous calendar
  year is above $28 (adjusted for inflation from 1990), the credit is reduced in proportion
  to the ratio of the excess over the $28 threshold to $6. Beyond a $6 difference,
  the credit is fully phased out.
