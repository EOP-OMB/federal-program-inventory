objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law interest
  earned on State and local government debt issued to finance hospital construction
  is excluded from income subject to tax.
