results:
- description: "(AY) 2021-2022, the GACA Program directly supported 24 faculty, including\
    \ 14 physicians specializing in geriatrics or geriatric psychiatry and two nurse\
    \ practitioners specializing in gerontology. GACA-supported faculty gave 94 conference\
    \ presentations, received 35 research or education grants, and published 32 articles\
    \ in peer reviewed journals. GACA fellows also delivered 14,142 hours of education\
    \ through 325 unique training programs and workshops. These courses reached 14,458\
    \ faculty, health professionals, and students specializing in medicine (35 percent),\
    \ public health (15 percent), nursing (14 percent), behavioral health (12 percent),\
    \ and other disciplines (24 percent). In FY 2022, there were 24 grant recipients.\
    \ However, three grant recipients relinquished their GACA awards due to being\
    \ promoted. The GACA Program is for instructors and assistant professors only.\
    \ GACA candidates that are promoted within the grant\u2019s period of performance\
    \ are required to relinquish their grant. Therefore, HRSA funded 21 non-competing\
    \ continuation awards. In FY 2023, HRSA is planning a new competition to fund\
    \ 26 grant recipients."
