objective: "Public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provide some\
  \ of the most diverse outdoor recreation opportunities on Federal lands in the western\
  \ United States. The BLM\u2019s Recreation and Visitor Services Program oversees\
  \ a broad and complex set of recreation related programs. These recreation resources\
  \ and visitor services support strong local economies and public land conservation.\
  \ The BLM manages recreation resources and visitor services to offer the greatest\
  \ benefits possible to individuals and communities and to better enable communities\
  \ to achieve their own desired social, economic, and environmental outcomes. BLM\
  \ continues to advance the Department of the Interior\u2019s priorities to increase\
  \ environmental protections, pursue environmental justice, and honor our nation-to-nation\
  \ relationship with Tribes.\_\_ This program will support projects funded under\
  \ the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem\
