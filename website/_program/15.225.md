objective: 'The BLM makes it a priority to enhance access to the outdoors and to promote
  exceptional outdoor recreation opportunities on public lands. The Recreation and
  Visitor Services Program oversees a broad and complex set of recreation-related
  activities. Through these activities, the BLM strengthens relationships with sovereign
  Tribal Nations and neighboring communities, supports the creation of recreation-related
  jobs, and promotes restoration and conservation. The BLM also promotes equity and
  environmental justice to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background or
  circumstances, has access to their public lands and waters.

  Recreational use on public lands is increasing every year, as are the challenges
  and impacts from increased activity. New technologies and information sharing are
  constantly changing visitor use patterns. To tackle these challenges head-on, the
  BLM has developed a new strategy called the â€œBlueprint for 21st Century Outdoor
  Recreation." The strategy is based on four key pillars that aim to transform recreation
  management across the agency: 1) Grow and Diversity Resources for BLM Recreation,
  2) Prioritize and Embrace Partnerships, 3) Expand Outreach and Establish a Culture
  of Inclusion, and 4) Meet the Demand, Protect Resources, and Improve Access. These
  pillars will guide investments, partnerships, outreach, and program development
  to respond to current demand and chart a course to meet future needs.'
