objective: 'The Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG) program is authorized under the
  Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C.
  §4101 et seq.) (NAHASDA). Regulations for the program, which are found at 24 CFR
  Part 1000, were written by HUD in negotiation with Tribes and Tribally Designated
  Housing Entities (TDHEs). The grants, which are awarded based on a formula to Tribes
  and TDHEs, fund a range of affordable housing activities that primarily benefit
  low-income American Indian and Alaska Native families living in Indian Country and
  include activities that: 1) assist and promote affordable housing activities to
  develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments
  on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by low-income Indian
  families; 2) coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their
  members and to promote self-sufficiency and their members; 3) plan for and integrate
  infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for Indian tribes.'
