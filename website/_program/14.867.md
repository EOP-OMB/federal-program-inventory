objective: "The Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG) program is authorized under the\
  \ Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C.\
  \ \xA74101 et seq.) (NAHASDA). Regulations for the program, which are found at 24\
  \ CFR Part 1000, were written by HUD in negotiation with Tribes and Tribally Designated\
  \ Housing Entities (TDHEs). The grants, which are awarded based on a formula to\
  \ Tribes and TDHEs, fund a range of affordable housing activities that primarily\
  \ benefit low-income American Indian and Alaska Native families living in Indian\
  \ Country and include activities that: 1) assist and promote affordable housing\
  \ activities to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy\
  \ environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by\
  \ low-income Indian families; 2) coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian\
  \ tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency and their members; 3)\
  \ plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing\
  \ development for Indian tribes."
