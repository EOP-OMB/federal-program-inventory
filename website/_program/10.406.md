objective: "The Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers direct and guaranteed loans to farmers\
  \ and ranchers to promote, build, and sustain family farms for a thriving agricultural\
  \ economy. The goal of FSA\u2019s farm loan program is to provide supervised credit\
  \ and management assistance to eligible farmers to become owners or operators, or\
  \ both, of family farms or to continue such operations when credit is not available\
  \ elsewhere. Operating loans (OL) must be essential to the success of the farm operation\
  \ and should establish and/or maintain financial viability. Guaranteed loans are\
  \ available to farmers who may not meet loan qualifications from a commercial lender.\
  \ Guaranteed loans are made and serviced by commercial lenders, such as banks, Farm\
  \ Credit System institutions, or credit unions."
