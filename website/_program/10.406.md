objective: The Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers direct and guaranteed loans to farmers
  and ranchers to promote, build, and sustain family farms for a thriving agricultural
  economy. The goal of FSAâ€™s farm loan program is to provide supervised credit and
  management assistance to eligible farmers to become owners or operators, or both,
  of family farms or to continue such operations when credit is not available elsewhere.
  Operating loans (OL) must be essential to the success of the farm operation and
  should establish and/or maintain financial viability. Guaranteed loans are available
  to farmers who may not meet loan qualifications from a commercial lender. Guaranteed
  loans are made and serviced by commercial lenders, such as banks, Farm Credit System
  institutions, or credit unions.
