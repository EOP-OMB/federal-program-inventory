objective: 'The Social Services Research and Demonstration program (SSRD) was authorized
  to promote research and demonstration projects related to the prevention and reduction
  of dependency, or to improve the administration and effectiveness of programs intended
  to prevent or reduce dependency.

  Projects funded under SSRD include the Behavioral Interventions Scholars, the Center
  for Research on Hispanic Children and Families, the National African American Child
  and Family Research Center, the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic
  Mobility, the Diaper Distribution Demonstration and Research Pilot, the Affordable
  Housing and Supportive Services demonstration, and the Medical Legal Partnerships
  Plus demonstration. The objectives of the Behavioral Intervention Scholars are to
  1) support studies that apply a behavioral science lens to specific research questions
  relevant to social services programs and policies and other issues facing low-income
  families, and 2) add to the growing body of knowledge on effective behavioral interventions
  for ACF programs and populations. The objectives of the Center for Research on Hispanic
  Children and Families are to lead and support research on the needs of 1) the Hispanic
  populations served by ACF, and 2) on promising approaches to promote social and
  economic well-being among low-income Hispanic families. The objectives of the National
  African American Child and Family Research Center are to lead and support research
  on 1) the assets, needs, and experiences of African American families and children
  served by ACF programs, and 2) on promising approaches to address economic and social
  inequities and, ultimately, to promote social and economic well-being among low-income
  African American families. The objectives of the National Research Center on Poverty
  and Economic Mobility are to fund projects and programs designed to 1) improve the
  effectiveness of public policies that reduce poverty, inequality, and their consequences,
  2) promote economic mobility and equity, and 3) further develop knowledge of the
  structural causes of poverty, inequality, and economic insecurity. The objectives
  of the Diaper Distribution Demonstration and Research Pilot are to evaluate the
  ability of community action agencies, social services agencies, and other non-profit
  community organizations to provide diapers and diapering supplies on a consistent
  basis through diaper distribution programs while also providing wraparound support
  services for families with low incomes. The objectives of the Affordable Housing
  and Supportive Services demonstration are to test the outcomes of strengthening
  wraparound supportive services for residents of affordable housing on individual
  and family safety, stability, and economic mobility. The objectives of the Medical
  Legal Partnerships Plus demonstration are to 1) provide support for medical-legal
  partnerships to build, expand, and strengthen their capacity to provide comprehensive
  legal services and wraparound social services to families with low incomes, and
  2) to test the outcomes of these activities.'
