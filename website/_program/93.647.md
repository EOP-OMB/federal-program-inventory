objective: "The Social Services Research and Demonstration program (SSRD) was authorized\
  \ to promote research and demonstration projects related to the prevention and reduction\
  \ of dependency, or to improve the administration and effectiveness of programs\
  \ intended to prevent or reduce dependency. Projects funded under SSRD include the\
  \ Behavioral Interventions Scholars, the Center for Research on Hispanic Children\
  \ and Families, the National African American Child and Family Research Center,\
  \ the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic Mobility, the Diaper Distribution\
  \ Demonstration and Research Pilot, the Affordable Housing and Supportive Services\
  \ demonstration, the Medical Legal Partnerships Plus demonstration.\n\nThe objectives\
  \ of the Behavioral Intervention Scholars are  to 1) support studies that apply\
  \ a behavioral science lens to specific research questions relevant to social services\
  \ programs and policies and other issues facing low-income families, and 2) add\
  \ to the growing body of knowledge on effective behavioral interventions for ACF\
  \ programs and populations. \nThe objectives of the Center for Research on Hispanic\
  \ Children and Families are to lead and support research on the needs of 1) the\
  \ Hispanic populations served by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)\
  \ and 2) on promising approaches to promote social and economic well-being among\
  \ low-income Hispanic families. \n\nThe objectives of the National African American\
  \ Child and Family Research Center are to lead and support research on 1) the assets,\
  \ needs, and experiences of African American families and children served by ACF\
  \ programs, and 2) on promising approaches to address economic and social inequities\
  \ and, 3) ultimately, promote social and economic well-being among low-income African\
  \ American families. \n\nThe objectives of the National Research Center on Poverty\
  \ and Economic Mobility are to fund projects and programs designed to 1) improve\
  \ the effectiveness of public policies that reduce poverty, inequality, and their\
  \ consequences, 2) promote economic mobility and equity, and 3) further develop\
  \ knowledge of the structural causes of poverty, inequality, and economic insecurity.\
  \ \n\nThe objectives of the Diaper Distribution Demonstration and Research Pilot\
  \ is to evaluate the ability of community action agencies, social services agencies,\
  \ and other non-profit community organizations to provide diapers and diapering\
  \ supplies on a consistent basis through diaper distribution programs while also\
  \ providing wraparound support services for families with low incomes. \n\nThe objectives\
  \ of the Affordable Housing and Supportive Services demonstration are to test the\
  \ outcomes of strengthening wraparound supportive services for residents of affordable\
  \ housing on individual and family safety, stability, and economic mobility. \n\n\
  The objectives of the Medical Legal Partnerships Plus demonstration are to 1) provide\
  \ support for medical-legal partnerships to build, expand, and strengthen their\
  \ capacity to provide comprehensive legal services and wraparound social services\
  \ to families with low incomes and 2) to test the outcomes of these activities."
