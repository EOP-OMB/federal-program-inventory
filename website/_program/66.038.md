objective: 'To support Federally-recognized Indian Tribes'' efforts to understand,
  assess and characterize air quality; design methods and plans to protect and improve
  air quality on tribal lands through surveys, studies, research, training, investigations,
  and special purpose activities. To ensure tribes have appropriate levels of support
  and opportunity to understand their air quality and take proactive measures to preserve,
  restore and protect air quality for their reservations and other lands over which
  they have jurisdiction through Tribal program implementation, CAA implementation,
  radiation protection, mobile source controls, and voluntary programs to address
  outdoor and indoor air and other concerns. To ensure that all Tribes have the tools
  they need to understand and participate in local, regional and national issues,
  regulatory and policy developments, and to protect their air quality from activities
  off the reservation that may affect or impact them. To improve the ability of tribes
  to understand, define, design and participate in activities that affect their air
  quality.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: EPA and Tribes, in partnership, will protect
  public health, the environment, and unique Tribal air resources, consistent with
  the CAA, its Amendments, and EPA''s trust responsibilities. This program will ensure
  Tribes have appropriate levels of support and opportunity to understand their own
  air quality and take proactive measures to preserve, restore, and protect air quality
  for their reservations and other lands over which they have jurisdiction through
  CAA implementation, radiation protection, mobile source controls, and voluntary
  programs to address air quality, climate change and other concerns. Activities will
  ensure that all Tribes have the tools they need to understand and participate in
  local, regional, and national issues and to protect their air quality from changes
  off reservation that may impact them. Key activities include: (1) Training and Program
  Development; (2) Assessment and Monitoring; (3) Developing capacity or a plan for
  eligibility under the Tribal Authority Rule; (4) Delegation or Ongoing Capability
  Development; (5) Tribal Implementation Plan development.'
