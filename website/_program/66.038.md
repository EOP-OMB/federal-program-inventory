objective: To support Federally-recognized Indian Tribes' efforts to understand, assess
  and characterize air quality; design methods and plans to protect and improve air
  quality on tribal lands through surveys, studies, research, training, investigations,
  and special purpose activities. To ensure tribes have appropriate levels of support
  and opportunity to understand their air quality and take proactive measures to preserve,
  restore and protect air quality for their reservations and other lands over which
  they have jurisdiction through Tribal program implementation, CAA implementation,
  radiation protection, mobile source controls, and voluntary programs to address
  outdoor and indoor air and other concerns. To ensure that all Tribes have the tools
  they need to understand and participate in local, regional and national issues,
  regulatory and policy developments, and to protect their air quality from activities
  off the reservation that may affect or impact them. To improve the ability of tribes
  to understand, define, design and participate in activities that affect their air
  quality.
