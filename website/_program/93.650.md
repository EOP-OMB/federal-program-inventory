objective: "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Medicare\
  \ and Medicaid Innovation (the Innovation Center), will assess whether systematically\
  \ identifying and addressing the health-related social needs of community-dwelling\
  \ Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, including those who are dually eligible,\
  \ impacts those beneficiaries\u2019 total health care costs and their inpatient\
  \ and outpatient utilization. Section 3021 of the ACA authorizes the Innovation\
  \ Center to design, implement and evaluate innovative payment and service delivery\
  \ models to improve quality and reduce costs. Rigorous evaluation requirements of\
  \ the model\u2019s impact influence model design parameters.\n\nThe Accountable\
  \ Health Communities (AHC) Model is based on emerging evidence that addressing health-related\
  \ social needs through enhanced clinical-community linkages can improve health outcomes\
  \ and reduce costs. This model will support community collaboration to systematically:\
  \ (1) screen beneficiaries to identify unmet health-related social needs; (2) refer\
  \ beneficiaries to increase awareness of community services; (3) provide person-centered\
  \ navigation services to assist beneficiaries with accessing community services\
  \ to resolve health related social needs; and (4) align clinical and community services\
  \ to ensure that community services are available and responsive to the needs of\
  \ beneficiaries. The expectation is that these efforts will lead to a reduction\
  \ in health care utilization and costs. The funding opportunity announcement (FOA)\
  \ initially offered three interventions of varying intensity (each referred to as\
  \ a \u201Ctrack\u201D) to better link beneficiaries to community services: the Assistance\
  \ Track Intervention, the Alignment Track Intervention or a third opportunity called\
  \ the Awareness Track.\n\nThe Awareness Track opportunity has subsequently been\
  \ withdrawn.\n\nThe Assistance Track Intervention tests whether assisting beneficiaries\
  \ with accessing services through community service navigation impacts total health\
  \ care cost and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization. This intervention\
  \ offers universal screening of health-related social needs, use of a community\
  \ resource inventory to connect beneficiaries to available community services, identification\
  \ of high-risk beneficiaries as part of a smarter spending strategy to target additional\
  \ resources where they are needed the most, and community service navigation to\
  \ assist high risk beneficiaries with resolving health-related social needs.\n\n\
  The Alignment Track Intervention builds on the intervention of the Assistance Track\
  \ and tests whether a combination of navigation services at the individual beneficiary\
  \ level and partner alignment at the community level impacts total health care costs\
  \ and ED visits and inpatient hospital admissions. This approach recognizes that\
  \ there are significant barriers to effective integration of the health care delivery\
  \ systems, governmental public health systems, and the community-based service system\
  \ due to different cultures, funding streams and data systems. Effective and responsive\
  \ infrastructures are needed to ensure that community services are available and\
  \ address the health-related social needs of beneficiaries. The Alignment intervention\
  \ incorporates innovations included in the Assistance Track and adds structural\
  \ and financial support designed to foster community-wide realignment of resources\
  \ to more effectively address beneficiaries\u2019 health-related social needs. Successful\
  \ applicants were selected to participate in a single track for a five-year period.\
  \ Although tracks share common design elements, each track\u2019s intervention pathway\
  \ and underlying hypothesis is distinct."
