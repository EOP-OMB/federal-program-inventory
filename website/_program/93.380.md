objective: The purpose of this program is to develop effective approaches for translation
  of evidence-based recommendations and implementation of activities in cancer genomics
  in public health settings.  Specifically applicants will be asked to translate the

  and the EGAPP recommendation on tumor screening for Lynch syndrome for implementation
  into public health practice.
