objective: 'The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, 42 U.S.C. 16132 et seq., as amended,
  authorizes EPA to award grants, rebates and loans to eligible entities to fund diesel
  emissions reductions. Emission reductions are achieved through the implementation
  of a certified engine configuration, verified retrofit technology, or emerging technology
  for buses (including school buses), medium heavy-duty or heavy heavy-duty diesel
  trucks, marine engines, locomotives, or nonroad engines used in construction, handling
  of cargo (including at port or airport), agriculture, mining, or energy production.
  In addition, eligible entities may also use funds to reduce long-duration idling
  using verified idle-reduction technology with certain vehicles or equipment described
  above. The objective of this program is to achieve significant reductions in diesel
  emissions and exposure, particularly from fleets operating in areas designated by
  the Administrator as poor air quality areas. Priority is given to projects which
  promote environmental justice (EJ) by demonstrating benefits to disadvantaged communities.
  EJ is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of
  race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation
  and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The National DERA program works to reduce
  the pollution emitted from diesel engines across the country through the implementation
  of various control strategies and involvement of national, state, local and private
  partners. Priority will be given to projects which achieve significant reductions
  in diesel emissions and exposure, particularly from fleets operating in poor air
  quality areas and/or service goods movement facilities. Further, priority for funding
  may be given to projects which benefit and engage disadvantaged communities, and
  those which can demonstrate project sustainability, climate change adaptation and
  workforce development.'
