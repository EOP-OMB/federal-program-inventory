objective: "The goal of the RCPGP is to build regional capacity and enhance community\
  \ resilience in the face of catastrophic disasters and other environmental stressors,\
  \ with a particular focus on addressing the needs of underserved communities and\
  \ populations that are disproportionately impacted by these events. While the specific\
  \ timeframe for achieving the goals may vary depending on the scope and nature of\
  \ the activities and initiatives being undertaken, RCPGP is designed to support\
  \ longer-term planning and implementation efforts beyond the period of performance.\
  \ \n\nThe main objectives of the RCPGP are as follows: \n\nTo strengthen regional\
  \ collaboration and coordination among government agencies and stakeholders to improve\
  \ preparedness for catastrophic events. This objective is facilitated by supporting\
  \ the development and implementation of regional catastrophic preparedness plans.\
  \ These plans are designed to identify the risks, challenges, and potential impacts\
  \ of catastrophic disasters and establish strategies for coordinating response efforts\
  \ across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines to reduce long-term vulnerability.\
  \ \n\nTo enhance the capacity of regions to identify and address gaps in planning,\
  \ training, and exercises related to catastrophic events. Through the RCPGP, regions\
  \ can identify areas where they lack preparedness and allocate resources to address\
  \ those gaps, thereby increasing community resiliency and community readiness. Additionally,\
  \ the program funds exercises and training opportunities that help communities practice\
  \ and improve their response to catastrophic events. \n\nTo improve the readiness\
  \ and resilience of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, communication\
  \ networks, community housing and shelters (one of three RCPGP core capabilities\
  \ for FY 2023), and public health facilities, in the event of a catastrophic incident.\
  \ This includes identifying critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, conducting\
  \ risk assessments, and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. The RCPGP\
  \ also encourages collaboration and coordination to ensure a more comprehensive\
  \ and integrated approach to disaster response. \n\n\nTo increase public awareness\
  \ and understanding of the risks associated with catastrophic events and the importance\
  \ of preparedness measure by supporting initiatives that promote public education\
  \ and outreach, particularly to disadvantaged communities to increase equity. \n\
  \nThese objectives are achieved over the program's multi-year timeframe and are\
  \ monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure progress towards achieving them. The\
  \ objectives are designed to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and\
  \ Time-bound (SMART) to provide a clear roadmap for program implementation and to\
  \ facilitate the measurement of program effectiveness."
