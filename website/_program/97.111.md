objective: "The goal of the RCPGP is to build regional capacity and enhance community\
  \ resilience in the face of catastrophic disasters and other environmental stressors,\
  \ with a particular focus on addressing the needs of underserved communities and\
  \ populations that are disproportionately impacted by these events. While the specific\
  \ timeframe for achieving the goals may vary depending on the scope and nature of\
  \ the activities and initiatives being undertaken, RCPGP is designed to support\
  \ longer-term planning and implementation efforts beyond the period of performance.\
  \ \n\nThe main objectives of the RCPGP are as follows: \n\nTo strengthen regional\
  \ collaboration and coordination among government agencies and stakeholders to improve\
  \ preparedness for catastrophic events. This objective is facilitated by supporting\
  \ the development and implementation of regional catastrophic preparedness plans.\
  \ These plans are designed to identify the risks, challenges, and potential impacts\
  \ of catastrophic disasters and establish strategies for coordinating response efforts\
  \ across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines to reduce long-term vulnerability.\
  \ \n\nTo enhance the capacity of regions to identify and address gaps in planning,\
  \ training, and exercises related to catastrophic events. Through the RCPGP, regions\
  \ can identify areas where they lack preparedness and allocate resources to address\
  \ those gaps, thereby increasing community resiliency and community readiness. Additionally,\
  \ the program funds exercises and training opportunities that help communities practice\
  \ and improve their response to catastrophic events. \n\nTo improve the readiness\
  \ and resilience of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, communication\
  \ networks, community housing and shelters (one of three RCPGP core capabilities\
  \ for FY 2023), and public health facilities, in the event of a catastrophic incident.\
  \ This includes identifying critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, conducting\
  \ risk assessments, and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. The RCPGP\
  \ also encourages collaboration and coordination to ensure a more comprehensive\
  \ and integrated approach to disaster response. \n\n\nTo increase public awareness\
  \ and understanding of the risks associated with catastrophic events and the importance\
  \ of preparedness measure by supporting initiatives that promote public education\
  \ and outreach, particularly to disadvantaged communities to increase equity. \n\
  \nThese objectives are achieved over the program's multi-year timeframe and are\
  \ monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure progress towards achieving them. The\
  \ objectives are designed to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and\
  \ Time-bound (SMART) to provide a clear roadmap for program implementation and to\
  \ facilitate the measurement of program effectiveness."

    capacity to manage catastrophic incidents by improving and expanding regional
    collaboration for catastrophic incident preparedness, including pandemic preparedness.
    The RCPGP has contributed to breaking the cycle of repeated flood damage and associated
    insurance claims. Additionally, RCPGP has enhanced community resilience by supporting
    projects that reduce flood risks and improve preparedness, helping communities
    become more resilient in the face of catastrophic incidents.
