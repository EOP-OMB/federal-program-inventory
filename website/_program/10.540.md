objective: The objective of this opportunity was to announce the availability of funds
  to establish the Participant Research Innovation Laboratory for Enhancing WIC Services.
  The role of the PRIL is to support and evaluate local efforts to develop interactive
  tools, technical resources, or innovative solutions that improve customer service
  in WIC clinics and/or WIC retailers (referred to hereafter as WIC vendors) and ultimately
  encourage and improve retention of eligible children in WIC. Research projects build
  on and improve our understanding of the diverse personal experiences, perceptions,
  and attitudes of those eligible for WIC services. Implemented strategies/solutions
  will be evaluated for their impact on participant satisfaction and retention, and
  other relevant measures, within the local agency setting. In addition, the Grantee,
  Johns Hopkins University, will provide evaluation-related technical assistance to
  State and local WIC agencies carrying out similar interventions through WIC Special
  Project Grants or other awards.
