objective: 'To assist states, territories, tribes, or intertribal consortia (leaking
  underground storage tank prevention only for tribes or intertribal consortia) that
  meet the requirements at 40 CFR 35.504 to develop and implement underground storage
  tank (UST) programs and for leak prevention, compliance, and other activities authorized
  by the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005, Public Law 105-276, and EPA''s annual
  appropriations acts. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Assistance agreements
  to states under Section 2007 of the Solid Waste and Disposal Act will support core
  program UST activities, implement their leak prevention and detection programs,
  as well as the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPAct) leak prevention activities. High priority
  tasks include providing financial assistance to states for the following: 1) adopting
  and implementing EPA''s recently-released regulatory revisions; 2) approving specific
  technologies to detect leaks from tank systems; 3) ensuring that tank owners and
  operators are complying with notification and other requirements; 4) ensuring equipment
  compatibility; 5) conducting UST inspections; 6) implementing operator training;
  7) prohibiting delivery for non-complying facilities; 8) seeking state program approval
  to operate the UST program in lieu of the federal program; and 9) requiring secondary
  containment. Leaking underground storage tank (LUST) prevention assistance agreements
  to states, tribes, or intertribal consortia for activities authorized by EPAct will
  support states with inspections and other release prevention and compliance assurance
  activities for federally regulated UST systems, as well as for enforcement activities
  related to release prevention. A main cause of releases is the lack of proper operation
  and maintenance of UST systems, which is why the EPA published revised UST regulations
  in FY 2015 that address these and other important issues. These changes will require
  subsequent state adoption, applicable updates to state regulations, and updates
  to state program approval. For tribes, the LUST prevention assistance agreements
  will assist with all aspects of the tribal programs, e.g., inspection capacity.
  High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to tribes for: 1) inspecting
  UST facilities to complete the three-year inspection requirement; 2) developing
  inspection capacity for tribes; 3) enforcement activities related to release prevention;
  4) development of leak prevention regulations and other program infrastructure;
  5) helping tribes develop the capacity to administer UST programs, such as providing
  funding to support training for tribal staff and educating owners and operators
  in Indian country about UST requirements. These activities are geared toward bringing
  all UST systems into compliance with release detection and release prevention requirements
  and minimizing future releases. Priority will be given to providing funds to enable
  the states to meet their responsibilities under Title XV, Subtitle B of the Energy
  Policy Act of 2005. States that have entered into assistance agreements with EPA
  must have the authority to inspect and take other compliance and related enforcement
  actions to prevent releases from USTs.'
