objective: The purpose of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR)
  Program is to restore natural resources and their services that have been injured
  by an oil spill or hazardous substance release for the benefit of the American people.
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a trustee for threatened and endangered species,
  migratory birds, at-risk species, and interjurisdictional fishes. We identify natural
  resources and their services that have been injured, determine the extent of the
  injuries, recover damages from responsible parties, and plan and carry out natural
  resource restoration activities.

- description: In FY16, there were a few restoration projects that resulted in an
    unusually large number of acres managed/protected or made available for recreational
    opportunities.  Therefore, we anticipate FY accomplishments to include approximately
    4,000 acres and 100 miles of habitat enhanced or restored, 150,000 acres and 200
    miles of habitat managed or protected, and 29,000 acres and 200 miles made available
    for recreational opportunities.  We based this estimate on the 4 year average
    for each category.  More than 6,000 acres and 200 streams/shorelines were enhanced
    and/or restored.  More than 20,000 acres were newly managed, and more than 4,500
    acres were protected through fee title or conservation easement.  Nearly 400 river
    miles and 3,500 acres were made available for recreational opportunities.  A total
    of 85 restoration projects were completed.  Of those 85 projects, 26 projects
    benefited threatened or endangered species, 56 projects benefited migratory birds,
    30 projects benefited interjurisdictional fishes, and 1 project benefited marine
    mammals (some projects benefited more than one trust resource category).
  year: '2017'
- description: More than 1,900 acres of habitat and 130 miles of streams/shorelines
    were enhanced and/or restored. More than 42,000 acres were newly managed, and

    Nearly 50 river miles and 5,700 acres were made available for recreational opportunities.
    A total of 74 restoration projects were completed. Of those 74 projects, 31 projects
    benefited threatened or endangered species, 60 projects benefited migratory birds,
    28 projects benefited interjurisdictional fishes, and 6 projects benefited marine
    mammals (some projects benefited more than one trust resource category).
  year: '2018'
- description: More than 6,800 acres of habitat and 8,209 miles of streams/shorelines
