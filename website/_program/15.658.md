objective: The purpose of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR)
  Program is to restore natural resources and their services that have been injured
  by an oil spill or hazardous substance release for the benefit of the American people.
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a trustee for threatened and endangered species,
  migratory birds, at-risk species, and interjurisdictional fishes. We identify natural
  resources and their services that have been injured, determine the extent of the
  injuries, recover damages from responsible parties, and plan and carry out natural
  resource restoration activities.
