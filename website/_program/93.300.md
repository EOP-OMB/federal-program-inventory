- description: 'Funding is supporting the conduct of over 40 research studies and
    technical assistance initiatives by the Health Workforce Research Centers (HWRCs).  Collectively,
    this body of work addresses multiple segments of the health workforce, including
    allied health occupations, behavioral health providers, long-term care services,
    and oral health providers.  HWRC research studies also address key topics related
    to evolving models for health care delivery; assessing value-based care; and integrating
    health equity considerations into health workforce education and training.  Findings
    from current HWRC research studies and technical assistance initiatives are being
    disseminated at national meetings and conferences, as well as in regional and
    state forums and through webinars and other online resources.  In addition, a
    number of manuscripts are in development to disseminate HWRC research through
    publication in the peer-reviewed literature.  A particular highlight of the current
    year has been the development of an HWRC research alert system, which may be accessed
