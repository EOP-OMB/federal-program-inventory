objective: 'The Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units (CESU) Network is a national,
  collaborative consortium of federal agencies, tribes, universities, state and local
  governments, and other partners that provide scientific research, technical assistance,
  and education on natural and cultural resource issues to federal land management,
  environmental, and research agencies. There are currently 17 CESUs throughout the
  country. Each is comprised of a host university, multiple federal agencies, and
  additional academic and nonfederal partners. The mission of the CESU Network is  to:
  Provide resource managers with high-quality scientific research, technical assistance,
  and education; provide resource managers with solid natural resource information;
  deliver research and technical assistance that is timely, relevant to resource managers,
  and needed to develop and implement sound adaptive management approaches; ensure
  the independence and objectivity of research; create and maintain effective partnerships
  among federal agencies and universities to share resources and expertise; take full
  advantage of university resources while benefiting faculty and students; provide
  research, technical assistance, and educational functions within the context of
  cultural, social, biological, and physical sciences; enhance the ability of Federal
  natural and cultural resource managers to generate, acquire, synthesize, act upon,
  and articulate to the public sound research and scientific information; encourage
  professional development of federal scientists and enhance their ability to manage
  federal science resources efficiently.'
