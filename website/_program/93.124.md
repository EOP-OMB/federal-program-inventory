objective: The purpose of the Nurse Anesthetist Traineeship (NAT) program is to increase
  the supply and distribution of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) who
  are well prepared and well positioned to practice independently and collaboratively
  within interprofessional teams and to deliver evidence-based, high quality, and
  safe anesthesia and pain management services. The program aims to expand access
  to anesthesia services, especially to rural, urban, and tribal underserved communities
  nationwide. Eligible grant award recipients are accredited institutions that educate
  registered nurses to become nurse anesthetists; recipient institutions, in turn,
  disburse funds to students in the form of traineeship support.
