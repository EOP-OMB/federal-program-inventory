objective: The National Institute of  and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)
  mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis
  and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; training of basic and clinical scientists
  to carry out this research; and dissemination of information on research progress
  in these diseases. The Extramural Program promotes and supports basic, translational,
  and clinical studies of Systemic Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases, Skin Biology
  and Diseases, Bone Biology and Diseases, Muscle Biology and Diseases, and Joint
  Biology and Diseases and Orthopaedics. NIAMS Systemic Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases
  programs address basic, translational, and clinical research, including clinical
  trials and observational and mechanistic studies, focused on immune-mediated arthritis
  and autoimmune-related acute and chronic disorders in adults and children. NIAMS
  Skin Biology and Diseases programs support basic, translational, and clinical research
  in skin, including both common and rare skin diseases. These programs include investigations
  of the basic molecular, cellular, and developmental biology of skin, as well as
  studies of skin as an immune, sensory, endocrine, and metabolic organ. NIAMS Bone
  Biology and Diseases programs support research on the control of bone formation,
  resorption, and mineralization as well as the effects of signaling molecules on
  bone cells. They support clinical studies of interventions to prevent fractures
  associated with osteoporosis and research into less common bone diseases. NIAMS
  Muscle Biology and Diseases programs encourage research on muscle developmental
  biology, growth, maintenance, and hypertrophy; physiology of contraction; structural
  biology of the contractile apparatus; disease mechanisms; biomarkers and outcome
  measures; and development and clinical testing of therapies for conditions including
  the muscular dystrophies. NIAMS Joint Biology, Diseases, and Orthopaedics programs
  support a broad spectrum of research centered on the interplay among the bodyâ€™s
  muscles, bones, and connective tissues. They encourage tissue engineering and regenerative
  medicine research, molecular biology, imaging, and clinical research, and the treatment
  and prevention of orthopaedic conditions. NIAMS participates in the Small Business
  Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.
  The SBIR program is intended to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. The STTR program is intended
  to stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation through cooperative
  research and development carried out between small business concerns and research
  institutions; to foster technology transfer between small business concerns and
  research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation
  of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation.
