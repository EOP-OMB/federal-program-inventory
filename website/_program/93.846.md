objective: "The National Institute of  and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)\
  \ mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis\
  \ and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; training of basic and clinical scientists\
  \ to carry out this research; and dissemination of information on research progress\
  \ in these diseases. The Extramural Program promotes and supports basic, translational,\
  \ and clinical studies of Systemic Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases, Skin Biology\
  \ and Diseases, Bone Biology and Diseases, Muscle Biology and Diseases, and Joint\
  \ Biology and Diseases and Orthopaedics. NIAMS Systemic Rheumatic and Autoimmune\
  \ Diseases programs address basic, translational, and clinical research, including\
  \ clinical trials and observational and mechanistic studies, focused on immune-mediated\
  \ arthritis and autoimmune-related acute and chronic disorders in adults and children.\
  \ NIAMS Skin Biology and Diseases programs support basic, translational, and clinical\
  \ research in skin, including both common and rare skin diseases. These programs\
  \ include investigations of the basic molecular, cellular, and developmental biology\
  \ of skin, as well as studies of skin as an immune, sensory, endocrine, and metabolic\
  \ organ. NIAMS Bone Biology and Diseases programs support research on the control\
  \ of bone formation, resorption, and mineralization as well as the effects of signaling\
  \ molecules on bone cells. They support clinical studies of interventions to prevent\
  \ fractures associated with osteoporosis and research into less common bone diseases.\
  \ NIAMS Muscle Biology and Diseases programs encourage research on muscle developmental\
  \ biology, growth, maintenance, and hypertrophy; physiology of contraction; structural\
  \ biology of the contractile apparatus; disease mechanisms; biomarkers and outcome\
  \ measures; and development and clinical testing of therapies for conditions including\
  \ the muscular dystrophies. NIAMS Joint Biology, Diseases, and Orthopaedics programs\
  \ support a broad spectrum of research centered on the interplay among the body\u2019\
  s muscles, bones, and connective tissues. They encourage tissue engineering and\
  \ regenerative medicine research, molecular biology, imaging, and clinical research,\
  \ and the treatment and prevention of orthopaedic conditions. NIAMS participates\
  \ in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology\
  \ Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR program is intended to increase private sector\
  \ commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development;\
  \ to increase small business participation in Federal research and development;\
  \ and to foster and encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged\
  \ small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological\
  \ innovation. The STTR program is intended to stimulate and foster scientific and\
  \ technological innovation through cooperative research and development carried\
  \ out between small business concerns and research institutions; to foster technology\
  \ transfer between small business concerns and research institutions; to increase\
  \ private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research\
  \ and development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and economically\
  \ disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns\
  \ in technological innovation."
