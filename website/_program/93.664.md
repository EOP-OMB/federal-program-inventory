objective: Section 1003 Demonstration Project to Increase Substance Use Provider Capacity
  authorized a new demonstration to help states increase Medicaid substance use disorder
  provider capacity through education, training, and technical assistance. Through
  this demonstration, select states were awarded funding to develop and carry out
  approved activities that enable the state to assess its behavioral health treatment
  needs and increase the capacity and availability to provide substance use disorder
  treatment or recovery services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The demonstration includes
  planning grants and post-planning projects. Under section 1003(aa)(2)(A) (I-IV)),
  the HHS Secretary awarded planning grants totaling $48.4 million 15 states (based
  on geographic diversity, with a preference to states with a prevalence of opioid
  use disorders comparable to or higher than the national average). An additional
  $1.4 million in supplemental funding was subsequently awarded to the planning grantees.  From
  among the planning grantees, 5 states were selected to receive enhanced federal
  reimbursement, during a 36-month period, for substance use disorder treatment or
  recovery services furnished by providers participating under the State plan (or
  a waiver of such plan).
