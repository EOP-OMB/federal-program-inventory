  \ BLM provides national leadership to promote conservation of fish, wildlife and\
  \ plant conservation, which will help restore and protect lands containing noteworthy\
  \ resource values for regionally significant species of management concern or wetland\
  \ and riparian areas; restore and protect crucial habitat through vegetation treatments,\
  \ installation of wildlife friendly fences, and creating fish passages or barriers\
  \ to protect aquatic species. Restoration of wildlife habitat to restore and protect\
  \ sage grouse, desert tortoise, and other upland habitats for priority species as\
  \ well as instream and riparian habitat for migratory birds, endangered or special\
  \ status aquatic species and other native and priority species. Increase on-the-ground\
  \ project work to conserve, restore, and reduce the threats to sage-grouse and other\
  \ sensitive species in high priority habitats.  Continue consistent habitat monitoring\
  \ across the range of the Greater Sage-Grouse and other landscape species using\
  \ the Habitat Assessment Framework (HAF) and the land use plan habitat objectives\
  \ for sage grouse and other priority species.  Continue seed collections within\
  \ priority species habitat and continue to develop genetically appropriate native\
  \ and non-native plant material for use in habitat restoration. Continue to work\
  \ with partners to prioritize and implement priority species conservation actions.\n\
  The BLM manages these resources in cooperation with states, tribes, other federal\
  \ agencies, and non-governmental organizations."
