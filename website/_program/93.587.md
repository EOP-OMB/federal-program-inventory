objective: 'The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) offers Native Language programs
  to promote and ensure the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages
  for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Pacific
  Islanders from American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
  Islands (CNMI). The Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance (P&M)
  awards are 12, 24 or 36-month projects that enable communities to conduct a broad
  range of projects including teacher credentialing, language instruction, language
  resource developments, language assessments, and other projects that support the
  communitiesâ€™ long-term language preservation goals. The Esther Martinez Immersion
  (EMI) awards are 36, 48, or 60-month projects that will be awarded to applicants
  that meet the statutory requirements for immersion projects with language nests
  or language survival schools in accordance with 42 USC 2991b-3(c)(7)


  ANA supports locally determined projects that achieve community goals through specific,
  measurable outcomes. In an effort to perpetuate language preservation efforts for
  Native communities, if appropriate, all ANA funded language projects should identify
  opportunities for the replication or modification of such project for use by other
  Native Americans; and include a plan for the preservation of the products of the
  Native American language project for the benefit of future generations of Native
  Americans and other interested persons.


  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) authorized Section 816 of the Native Americans
  Programs Act (NAPA) of 1974 (42 USC 2992d) to amend Section 803C of NAPA (42 USC
  2991b-3) to create (g) Emergency Grants for Native American Language Preservation

  subsection (a) (1) to ensure the survival and continuing vitality of Native American
  languages during and after the public health emergency declared by the Secretary
