objective: "The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) offers Native Language programs\
  \ to promote and ensure the survival and continuing vitality of Native American\
  \ languages for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American\
  \ Pacific Islanders from American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern\
  \ Mariana Islands (CNMI). The Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance\
  \ (P&M) awards are 12, 24 or 36-month projects that enable communities to conduct\
  \ a broad range of projects including teacher credentialing, language instruction,\
  \ language resource developments, language assessments, and other projects that\
  \ support the communities\u2019 long-term language preservation goals. The Esther\
  \ Martinez Immersion (EMI) awards are 36, 48, or 60-month projects that will be\
  \ awarded to applicants that meet the statutory requirements for immersion projects\
  \ with language nests or language survival schools in accordance with 42 USC 2991b-3(c)(7)\n\
  \nANA supports locally determined projects that achieve community goals through\
  \ specific, measurable outcomes. In an effort to perpetuate language preservation\
  \ efforts for Native communities, if appropriate, all ANA funded language projects\
  \ should identify opportunities for the replication or modification of such project\
  \ for use by other Native Americans; and include a plan for the preservation of\
  \ the products of the Native American language project for the benefit of future\
  \ generations of Native Americans and other interested persons.\n\nThe American\
  \ Rescue Plan Act (ARP) authorized Section 816 of the Native Americans Programs\
  \ Act (NAPA) of 1974 (42 USC 2992d) to amend Section 803C of NAPA (42 USC 2991b-3)\
  \ to create (g) Emergency Grants for Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance\
  \ to issue awards to entities eligible to receive assistance under subsection (a)\
  \ (1) to ensure the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages\
  \ during and after the public health emergency declared by the Secretary with respect\
  \ to the COVID-19 pandemic."
