objective: 'The P&M program provides funding for projects designed to ensure continuing
  vitality of Native American languages. This program allows for a broad array of
  Native language-related projects including establishing a language program, improving
  an existing program, and developing language instruction and activities. The EMI
  program provides funding for community-based projects that ensure continuing vitality
  of Native languages through immersion-based instruction. EMI projects must meet
  the requirements for either a Native American language nest or a Native American
  language survival school, both of which are immersive, site-based educational programs
  for children in accordance with 42 USC 2991b-3(c)(7)


  ANA supports locally determined projects that achieve community goals through specific,
  measurable outcomes. In an effort to perpetuate language preservation efforts for
  Native communities, if appropriate, all ANA funded language projects should identify
  opportunities for the replication or modification of such project for use by other
  Native Americans; and include a plan for the preservation of the products of the
  Native American language project for the benefit of future generations of Native
  Americans and other interested persons.


  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) was established to create  Emergency Grants for
  Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance and issue awards to entities
  eligible to receive assistance under subsection (a) (1) to ensure the survival and
  continuing vitality of Native American languages during and after the public health
  emergency declared by the Secretary with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic.'
