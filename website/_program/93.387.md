objective: "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center\
  \ for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Office on Smoking\
  \ and Health (OSH) awards financial assistance to address tobacco use, the single\
  \ most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States and provides\
  \ support for comprehensive state-based tobacco control programs. This program supports\
  \ the achievement of four National Tobacco Control Program (NTCP) goals to (1) Prevent\
  \ initiation of tobacco use among youth and young adults; (2) Eliminate exposure\
  \ to secondhand smoke; (3) Promote quitting among adults and youth; and (4) Identify\
  \ and eliminate tobacco related disparities. Achievement of these goals will reduce\
  \ chronic disease morbidity, mortality, and disability related to tobacco use and\
  \ secondhand smoke exposure in the United States.  \nThis program will be comprised\
  \ of two components 1) Core Component and 2) Quitline Component."
