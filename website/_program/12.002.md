    from government to businesses.  PTACs assisted businesses entering or re-entering
    the government marketplace due to a downturn in their commercial business caused
    by the pandemic.  PTACs directed suppliers to the solicitations used by the government
    to procure critical supplies and equipment to support the pandemic response and
    helped them understand how to submit an offer to provide the supplies.
