objective: "The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and\
  \ Nonproliferation, Office of Export Control Cooperation (ISN/ECC) administers the\
  \ Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Program.  The EXBS Program Mission\
  \ is to enhance U.S. national security by preventing proliferation of WMD and illicit\
  \ trade in conventional weapons, and strengthen partner countries\u2019 capabilities\
  \ to comply with international strategic trade control norms and enforcement best\
  \ practices.  EXBS trains border security personnel and law enforcement officials\
  \ to detect, interdict, investigate, and prosecute illicit transfers of conventional\
  \ weapons and to ensure that international ports of entry have adequate equipment\
  \ to screen suspicious cargo.  EXBS also assists partner countries in the establishment\
  \ of independent strategic trade control authorities to regulate transfers of technologies\
  \ and material that could be used for WMD, related delivery systems, or advanced\
  \ conventional weapons.  To strengthen compliance with international strategic trade\
  \ control norms and U.N. sanctions resolutions, EXBS also conducts outreach to the\
  \ private sector to help industry better understand its nonproliferation obligations."
