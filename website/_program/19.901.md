objective: The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation,
  Office of Export Control Cooperation (ISN/ECC) administers the Export Control and
  Related Border Security (EXBS) Program.  The EXBS Program Mission is to enhance
  U.S. national security by preventing proliferation of WMD and illicit trade in conventional
  weapons, and strengthen partner countries’ capabilities to comply with international
  strategic trade control norms and enforcement best practices.  EXBS trains border
  security personnel and law enforcement officials to detect, interdict, investigate,
  and prosecute illicit transfers of conventional weapons and to ensure that international
  ports of entry have adequate equipment to screen suspicious cargo.  EXBS also assists
  partner countries in the establishment of independent strategic trade control authorities
  to regulate transfers of technologies and material that could be used for WMD, related
  delivery systems, or advanced conventional weapons.  To strengthen compliance with
  international strategic trade control norms and U.N. sanctions resolutions, EXBS
  also conducts outreach to the private sector to help industry better understand
  its nonproliferation obligations.
