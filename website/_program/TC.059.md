objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. Consumers pay for some deposit-linked
  services, such as check cashing, by accepting a below-market interest rate on their
  demand deposits. If they received a market rate of interest on those deposits and
  paid explicit fees for the associated services, they would pay taxes on the full
  market rate and (unlike businesses) could not deduct the fees. The Government thus
  foregoes tax on the difference between the risk-free market interest rate and below-market
  interest rates on demand deposits, which under competitive conditions should equal
  the value of deposit services.
