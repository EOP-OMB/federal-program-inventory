objective: The SBIR/STTR programs are congressionally mandated and intended to support
  scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of federal
  research funds to build a strong national economy by stimulating technological innovation
  in the private sector; strengthening the role of small business in meeting federal
  research and development needs; increasing the commercial application of federally
  supported research results; and fostering and encouraging participation by socially
  and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. Further, the objective
  of the STTR program is to stimulate formal cooperative partnerships of ideas and
  technologies between small businesses and nonprofit research institutions (e.g.,
  Universities, Federal Laboratories).
