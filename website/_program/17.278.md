objective: 'Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorized
  three of the six WIOA core programs.  The WIOA Dislocated Worker program is one
  of the three core programs.  The purpose of the WIOA Dislocated Worker (DW) program
  is to help dislocated workers get back to work as quickly as possible and overcome
  barriers to employment.  When individuals become dislocated workers as a result
  of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors,
  the DW program provides services to assist them in re-entering the workforce.  States
  can reserve up to 25 percent of their DW funds for Rapid Response activities.       The
  program''s success is measured by the following core indicators of performance:  1.
  Employment Rate - 2nd Quarter After Exit; 2. Employment Rate - 4th Quarter After
  Exit; 3. Median Earnings - 2nd Quarter After Exit; 4. Credential Attainment Rate;
  5. Measurable Skill Gains.'
