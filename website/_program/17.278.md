objective: 'Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorized
  three of the six WIOA core programs.  The WIOA Dislocated Worker program is one
  of the three core programs.  The purpose of the WIOA Dislocated Worker (DW) program
  is to help dislocated workers get back to work as quickly as possible and overcome
  barriers to employment.  When individuals become dislocated workers as a result
  of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors,
  the DW program provides services to assist them in re-entering the workforce.  States
  can reserve up to 25 percent of their DW funds for Rapid Response activities.       The
  program''s success is measured by the following core indicators of performance:  1.
  Employment Rate - 2nd Quarter After Exit; 2. Employment Rate - 4th Quarter After
  Exit; 3. Median Earnings - 2nd Quarter After Exit; 4. Credential Attainment Rate;
  5. Measurable Skill Gains.'

- description: States allocate Dislocated Worker funds to their local workforce development
    areas to provide career and training services to individuals who have lost their
    jobs through no fault of their own, including separating service members, military
    spouses, and displaced homemakers. Additionally, the program allows for states
    to reserve up to 25 percent of their Dislocated Worker funds for Rapid Response
    activities. Rapid Response is a pro-active, business-focused, and flexible strategy
    to help growing companies access an available pool of skilled workers and can
    respond to layoffs by quickly coordinating services and aid to companies and their
    workers.  For the first three quarters of Program Year 2020, the WIOA Dislocated
    Worker program served more than 702,000 participants; of those, more than 70,000
    received training, and more than 62,000 were low income individuals.  Of the more
    than 70,000 in training, 52.3 percent had a Measurable Skill Gain and over 70
    percent of exiters from training attained an industry-recognized credential.  After
    exiting the program, 61.9 percent of exiters were employed 2 quarters after exit.  Exiters
    who were employed had a median earnings of $8,535 in the 2nd quarter after exit
    (months 4-6).

    are the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the outlying areas.  However,

    areas the option to submit a single application according to the requirements
    established by the Secretary for a consolidated grant for Adult, Dislocated Worker
    and Youth funds.  Please refer to CFDA 17.290 for information on the outlying
    areas only.  PY allotments are comprised of Base funds (beginning of PY) + Advance
    funds (beginning of fiscal year).  Performance data is available for PY 2021 at
    https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/wioa-performance.  Performance data
