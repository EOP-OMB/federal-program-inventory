objective: Under the baseline tax system, worldwide income forms the tax base of U.S.
  corporations. In contrast, U.S. tax law exempts or preferentially taxes certain
  portions of this income. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA
  (effective January 1, 2018), active foreign income was generally taxed only upon
  repatriation. TCJA changed these rules, so that certain active income (called “global
  intangible low tax income” or “GILTI”) is taxed currently, even if it is not distributed.
  However, U.S. corporations generally receive a 50 percent deduction from U.S. tax
  on their GILTI (the deduction decreases to 37.5 percent in 2026), resulting in a
  substantially reduced rate of tax. In addition, some active income is excluded from
  tax, and distributions out of active income are no longer taxed upon repatriation.
  These reductions and exemptions from U.S. taxation are considered tax expenditures.
