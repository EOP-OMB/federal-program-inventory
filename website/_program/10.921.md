objective: The CSP provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation
  and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation
  purposes on Tribal and private working lands. Working lands include cropland, grassland,
  prairie land, improved pasture, and range land, as well as forested land that is
  an incidental part of an agriculture operation. The goal of CSP is to identify and
  reward those farmers and ranchers who are meeting the highest standards of conservation
  and environmental management on their operations and to support ongoing stewardship
  of private agricultural lands by providing payments for maintaining and enhancing
  natural resources.
