objective: "CISA’s mission is to lead the national effort to understand, manage, and\
  \ reduce risk to our cyber and physical infrastructure. In carrying out this mission,\
  \ Section 2202 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigns CISA with the responsibilities\
  \ to coordinate a national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure\
  \ risks, carry out cybersecurity and critical infrastructure stakeholder outreach\
  \ and engagement, and encourage and build cybersecurity awareness and competency\
  \ across the United States. Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes\
  \ CISA to make cooperative agreements in carrying out these responsibilities. \n\
  \nIn carrying out its mission and pursuant to these authorities, CISA provides financial\
  \ assistance under the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program to non-federal entities\
  \ to perform cybersecurity awareness activities to reduce cybersecurity risks through\
  \ messaging, tools, and resources to encourage individuals and organizations to\
  \ reduce their exposure to malicious cyber activity. Through strategies implemented\
  \ year-round with a focal point of Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October, a recipient\
  \ under a federal award will engage in efforts to improve the public’s understanding\
  \ of cyber threats, amplify opportunities that individuals and non-federal entities\
  \ can leverage to strengthen their own cybersecurity posture, and encourage discussion,\
  \ engagement, and actions that can be taken to reduce cyber risk. \n\nCISA has established\
  \ the following six goals for the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program: (1)\
  \ strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure; (2) assess\
  \ and counter evolving cybersecurity risks through actions that promote threat risk\
  \ reduction; (3) build a national culture of preparedness and ensure equity and\
  \ accessibility to increase online and digital safety; (4) build stakeholder relationships\
  \ that encourage and support data-driven actions by state, local, tribal, and territorial\
  \ governments, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, other non-federal entities,\
  \ and individuals that reduce cybersecurity risk; (5) reinforce the importance of\
  \ secure by default and secure by design industry practices that do not place the\
  \ first line of cyber threat risk reduction on those with the least capabilities\
  \ and resources; and (6) encourage activities supported by data which result in\
  \ key behavior change that reduce cyber risk.\n\nIn support of the six program goals,\
  \ CISA has established the following six objectives for the Cybersecurity Awareness\
  \ Campaign Program: (1) educate the public and non-federal entities about the dangers\
  \ of cyber threats and key actions to mitigate risks; (2) promote sustainable cybersecurity\
  \ and encourage the technology industry to provide secure-by-default technology\
  \ products and technology that is secure-by-design; (3) identify effective approaches\
  \ to increase cybersecurity awareness among the general public and target audiences;\
  \ (4) build relationships and coalitions across cybersecurity stakeholders to support\
  \ Cybersecurity Awareness Month; (5) develop a baseline from which to measure the\
  \ impact Cybersecurity Awareness Month campaign strategies and messaging has on\
  \ changing behavior and increasing public awareness of cybersecurity risk; and (6)\
  \ contribute to CISA’s efforts to build a culture of preparedness. \n\nThe Cybersecurity\
  \ Awareness Campaign Program aligns with Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical\
  \ Infrastructure and Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience under the 2020-2024\
  \ Department of Homeland Security Strategic Plan. It also supports Goal 2: Risk\
  \ Reduction and Resilience and Goal 3: Operational Collaboration under the CISA\
  \ Strategic Plan 2023-2025."
