objective: The U.S. Department of State's Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction (ISN/CTR),
  part of the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, supports programs
  aimed at reducing the threat posed by terrorist organizations or states of concern
  seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD) expertise, material, and equipment.  ISN/CTR
  programs, also known as Global Threat Reduction (GTR) programs, accomplish this
  task by funding a variety of projects that aim to enhance biological, chemical,
  and nuclear security practices and productively engage scientists with WMD-applicable
  expertise in civilian pursuits.  In addition to continued efforts in the former
  Soviet Union to engage  WMD experts, GTR programs are working to reduce the rapidly
  growing worldwide WMD threat posed by terrorists, non-state actors, and proliferant
  states.  GTR programs are threat-driven and focus on frontline states and in regions
  where the terrorist threat is on the rise.
