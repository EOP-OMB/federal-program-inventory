objective: The Indian Health Service (IHS) Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) consists
  of several funding programs designed to help Tribes and Tribal Organizations (T/TO)
  improve access to health care in their respective communities.  The national CHAP
  provides a network of health aides training to support licensed health professionals
  while providing direct health care, health promotion, and disease prevention services.  These
  providers work within a referral relationship under the supervision of licensed
  clinical providers that includes clinics, service units, and hospitals.  The CHAP
  will increase access to direct health services, including inpatient and outpatient
  visits.  The Tribal Assessment and Planning program is designed to support the assessment
  and planning of Tribes and Tribal Organizations  is determining the feasibility
  of implementing the CHAP in their respective communities.  The Tribal Planning and
  Implementation program is designed to support the final planning and implementation
  of Tribes and Tribal Organizations that are positioned to begin operating a CHAP.
