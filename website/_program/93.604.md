objective: The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides funding to the Services
  for Survivors of Torture Program which includes Direct Services for Survivors of
  Torture (DS SOT) program and Technical Assistance to Survivors of Torture program
  (TA SOT) program. The aim of the DS SOT program is to help survivors and their families
  overcome the severe, pervasive, and long-lasting effects of torture and achieve
  sustained physical, social, emotional, and economic well-being. To achieve this
  aim, ORR seeks to 1) increase survivors' access to and engagement with effective,
  holistic, strengths-based, trauma-informed services; and 2) to maintain and grow
  a strong and sustainable national network of culturally responsive service providers.
  The aim of the TA SOT program is to fund a healing torture and trauma initiative
  that includes 1) a national center to coordinate education, training, and research
  efforts, and 2) a strong and sustainable national network of organizations serving
  survivors of torture.
