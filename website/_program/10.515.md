objective: "The RREA-NFF, Assistance Listing 10.515, program goal is to enhance the\
  \ sustainability of US forest and rangeland resources, and to enable landowners\
  \ and managers to achieve their desired goals and objectives by making sound research\
  \ available to them. Forest and rangeland resources provide multiple benefits to\
  \ people\u2014including wildlife habitat, water supply, open space, recreation,\
  \ and cultural resources. Many of these lands are privately owned and managed for\
  \ forest products and livestock production. Forest and rangeland are susceptible\
  \ to land use conversion and climate change. RREA-NFF projects must maximize the\
  \ capacity, reach, and impact of the Cooperative Extension System \u2013 Extension\
  \ Forestry and Rangeland Programs to ensure appropriate management and conservation\
  \ of natural resources and to ensure climate change resilience. \nHandling of baseline\
  \ data and data collection will be addressed per approved project evaluation or\
  \ performance measures/outcomes."
