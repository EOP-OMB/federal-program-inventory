objective: "The RREA-NFF, Assistance Listing 10.515, program goal is to enhance the\
  \ sustainability of US forest and rangeland resources, and to enable landowners\
  \ and managers to achieve their desired goals and objectives by making sound research\
  \ available to them. Forest and rangeland resources provide multiple benefits to\
  \ people—including wildlife habitat, water supply, open space, recreation, and cultural\
  \ resources. Many of these lands are privately owned and managed for forest products\
  \ and livestock production. Forest and rangeland are susceptible to land use conversion\
  \ and climate change. RREA-NFF projects must maximize the capacity, reach, and impact\
  \ of the Cooperative Extension System – Extension Forestry and Rangeland Programs\
  \ to ensure appropriate management and conservation of natural resources and to\
  \ ensure climate change resilience. \nHandling of baseline data and data collection\
  \ will be addressed per approved project evaluation or performance measures/outcomes."
