- description: As a result of a $1.5M OEA Industry Resilience Investment, the Commonwealth
    of Kentucky Aerospace Industry Consortium helped increase Kentucky aerospace exports
    from $8.7B to $11.7B which contributed to the resilience of the DoD supply chain.  Kentucky
    manufacturers are a major element of the supply chain for the Virginia-class submarine,
    the Patriot Missile System, the Super Hercules C-130J and the Minuteman III Missile
    System.
  year: '2019'
- description: $2.6 million in Industry Resilience enabled the University of Michigan,
    Purdue University and the Ohio State University, on behalf of their respective
    states, to strengthen the cybersecurity of 173 small- to medium-size defense suppliers,
    many in rural areas of their respective states. In surveys, 40% of the companies
    served stated they would not have completed their cybersecurity compliance project,
    or would have significantly delayed implementation, thus weakening a critical
    portion of the ground systems supply chain. In addition, the universities have
    educated over 2,500 companies and/or individuals in the defense supply chain about
    cybersecurity requirements for defense companies.
  year: '2020'
- description: A $648k grant enabled the University of Alaska's Center for Economic
    Development to undertake the first comprehensive, statewide effort to analyze
    the economic impacts of the military in Alaska, understand the defense supply
    chain in the state, and identify the vendor base in detail. This information was
    shared widely, and highlighted, among other issues, the importance of portability
    of occupational licenses for military spouses. In 2022, the State Legislature
    passed a new law simplifying the licensing process for military spouses. Another
    proposed law would establish an Alaska Military Affairs Council to focus on military
    liaison functions at a high level.

- description: A $1.5M project enabled the Purdue University Manufacturing Extension
    Partnership to provide modernization assessments to improve the capabilities of
    at least 36 Indiana small Defense industrial base businesses; increase supply
    chain awareness; adapt to the requirements of government and industry prime contractors;
    and identify strategic growth opportunities.  More than 80 Indiana companies have
    benefited from the grant program in areas such as increased productivity, workforce
    training, cybersecurity, and technology adoption.  These activities ensure companies
    are prepared to support future Department of Defense capabilities.  This project
    stimulates cooperation between statewide and local adjustment and diversification
    efforts.
  year: '2022'
- description: A $1.5 million grant enabled the Purdue University Manufacturing Extension
    Partnership to provide technical assistance to improve the capabilities of 87
    Indiana small defense industrial base businesses; increase supply chain awareness;
    adapt to the requirements of government and industry prime contractors; and identify
    strategic growth opportunities. This project stimulated cooperation between statewide
    and local adjustment and diversification efforts making the industrial base more
    resilient to fluctuations in defense spending.
  year: '2023'
- description: A $1.5 million grant is enabling the Connecticut Department of Community
    and Economic Development to launch the Scaling Model-Based Definition project
    to develop tools to support the digital transformation of the defense supply chain
    across the state. This project will provide technical assistance and workforce
    development programs to scale technology integration efforts across more than
    700 defense suppliers in the state’s industrial base. This project stimulates
    cooperation between statewide and local diversification efforts.
