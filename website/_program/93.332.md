objective: 'Each year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) awards funding
  to organizations who serve as Navigators in states with a Federally-facilitated
  Exchange (FFE). This posting reflects a new 5-year funding opportunity, anticipated
  to start August 27, 2024.  Funded projects will be expected to operate as Navigators
  year-round, using the funding from CMS to conduct outreach and education in their
  communities—raising awareness among the remaining uninsured about the coverage options
  available to them, help consumers find affordable coverage that meets their needs
  primarily in the Health Insurance Marketplace, and to assist consumers beyond the
  enrollment process—ensuring they''re equipped with the tools and resources needed
  to utilize and maintain their health coverage all year.

  Navigators are required to provide targeted assistance to underserved and vulnerable
  populations within the FFE service area (state), which is critical to improving
  access to health care coverage for communities that have been historically disenfranchised
  and disproportionately impacted by significant health disparities.  In furtherance
  of Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved
  Communities Through the Federal Government, CMS encourages applications from organizations
  that are members of, or have a history of trusted ties with, the community(ies)
  and population(s) that they expect to target as Navigators, if awarded.'
