objective: 'The Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated
  Exchanges (Funding Opportunity) will enable recipients to operate as Exchange Navigators
  in states with a Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE), as authorized by the Affordable
  Care Act (ACA). Section 1311(i) of the ACA requires Exchanges to establish a Navigator
  grant program.


  The  Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations,
  and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond Final Rule (2022 Payment
  Notice (PN)) amended 45 C.F.R. § 155.210(e)(9) to reinstitute the requirement that
  Navigators in the FFEs provide information and assistance with regard to certain
  post-enrollment topics, such as the Exchange eligibility appeals process, the Exchange-related
  components of the Premium Tax Credit (PTC) reconciliation process, and the basic
  concepts and rights of health coverage and how to use it.

  The HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2024 final rule at https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-08368/p-142,
  effective 6/18/2023, removed the prohibition, i.e., now allowed, for Navigators,
  non-Navigator assistance personnel, certified application counselors (CACs), and
  CAC Designated Organizations (CDOs) in FFEs from going door-to-door or using unsolicited
  means of direct contact to provide application or enrollment assistance.'
