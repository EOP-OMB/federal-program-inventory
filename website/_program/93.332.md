objective: "The Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated\
  \ Exchanges (Funding Opportunity) will enable recipients to operate as Exchange\
  \ Navigators in states with a Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE), as authorized\
  \ by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Section 1311(i) of the ACA requires Exchanges\
  \ to establish a Navigator grant program.\n\nThe  Updating Payment Parameters, Section\
  \ 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for\
  \ 2022 and Beyond Final Rule (2022 Payment Notice (PN)) amended 45 C.F.R. \xA7 155.210(e)(9)\
  \ to reinstitute the requirement that Navigators in the FFEs provide information\
  \ and assistance with regard to certain post-enrollment topics, such as the Exchange\
  \ eligibility appeals process, the Exchange-related components of the Premium Tax\
  \ Credit (PTC) reconciliation process, and the basic concepts and rights of health\
  \ coverage and how to use it."
