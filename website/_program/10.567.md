objective: The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) is a nutrition
  assistance program that may be operated at the request of a Tribe or Indian Tribal
  Organization (ITO) on an Indian reservation, approved areas near a reservation,
  or approved service areas in Oklahoma. Income-eligible households receive a supplemental
  monthly food package and nutrition education. Households may not participate in
  FDPIR and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) simultaneously in
  the same month. In FY 2023, 105 ITOs and three State agencies (SAs) administered
  the program on approximately 279 Indian reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and Alaska
  Native Villages. All participating ITOs and SAs receive administrative funding for
  costs incurred in the operation of the program. Beginning in FY 2022, $4 million
  of the administrative funds line item is dedicated to be disseminated to FDPIR ITOs
  for nutrition related activities that promote healthy choices through the use of
  USDA Foods and physical activity among FDPIR participants Nutrition assistance and
  food packages were provided to an average of 45.2 thousand persons per month (FY
  2022).

    Assistance Act, to purchase USDA Foods for the FDPIR food package for their tribe.
    Beginning in FY 2022, USDA awarded $5.7 million dollars to Tribal nations participating

    some contracts expected to last up to three years, through 2024.
