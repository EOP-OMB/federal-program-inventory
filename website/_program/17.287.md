objective: 'The goal of the demonstration is to focus on creating IT-based training
  opportunities for Job Corps-eligible students that lead to placement in good paying
  IT careers.


  Prior demonstration project goals focused on determining whether institutes of higher
  education could provide quality job training and placement to students that is less
  costly and has better employment outcomes than the traditional Job Corps model.'
