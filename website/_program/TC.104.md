objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Under current law in 2023, however, there are two credits
  for certain post-secondary education expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit
  (AOTC) allows a partially refundable credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student
  for qualified tuition and related expenses paid. The AOTC may be claimed during
  each of the first four years of the student’s post-secondary education. The Lifetime
  Learning Credit (LLC) allows a non-refundable credit for 20 percent of an eligible
  student’s qualified tuition and fees, up to a maximum credit of $2,000 per return.
  The LLC may be claimed during any year of the student’s post-secondary education.
  Only one credit may be claimed per student per year. The combined credits are phased
  out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $160,000 and $180,000
  if married filing jointly ($80,000 and $90,000 for other taxpayers), not indexed.
  Married individuals filing separate returns cannot claim either credit.
