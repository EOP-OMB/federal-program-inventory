- description: The collaborative research team provided growers with new apps to help
    manage the threats of new pests and diseases for several distinctive crops, including
    coffee and macadamia nut, which thrive in a tropical environment, such as Hawaii,
    and threaten their livelihoods. The apps provide growers with a variety of information
    that they can use, such as informing on the appropriate timing of control measures,
    and providing diagnostic, management, and other information on a wide variety
    of pests and diseases of crops grown a tropical environment; and provides recommendations
    for postharvest quarantine treatments of crops for export.
