objective: "Under the Domestic Trafficking Victim Program, OVC has established the\
  \ Improving Outcomes for Child and Youth Victims of Human Trafficking Program. \
  \  The overarching goal of this program is to improve outcomes for children and\
  \ youth who are victims of human trafficking by integrating human trafficking policy\
  \ and programming at the state or tribal level and by enhancing a coordinated, multidisciplinary,\
  \ and jurisdiction-wide approach to human trafficking.\nUnder this Program, OJJDP\
  \ has established the Children’s Advocacy Center Subgrant Program for Victims of\
  \ Child Pornography under the Victims of Child Abuse Support for Children’s Advocacy\
  \ Centers (CAC) Program. The goal of this program is to support local CACs, state\
  \ chapters, and multidisciplinary teams (mdts) that provide a coordinated investigation\
  \ and comprehensive response to child abuse, specifically to provide services and\
  \ improve the response to children who are victims of child pornography, including\
  \ those victims of child pornography who are also victims of sex trafficking.\n\n\

  \ This strategy will also include developing a systematic method to screen for victimization\
  \ across entities; developing protocols and procedures to ensure child and youth\
  \ victims receive appropriate services; delivering staff training to implement and\
  \ sustain the strategy jurisdiction-wide; and strengthening data collection across\
  \ multiple systems of care.\n•\tDevelop, enhance, and coordinate programs and activities\
  \ geared toward improving outcomes for child and youth victims of sex and labor\
  \ trafficking. States or tribes should establish a program coordinator role to oversee\
  \ program implementation and ensure coordination of anti-trafficking efforts in\
  \ the state or tribal jurisdiction.\n\nSuccessful applicants funded through the\
  \ Children’s Advocacy Center Subgrant Program for Victims of Child Pornography will:Release\

  \ trafficking).\n•\tProvide oversight and monitoring of subaward activities.\n\n\
