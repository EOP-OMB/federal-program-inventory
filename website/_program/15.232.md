  \ to to prioritize efforts to reduce climate pollution; support climate resilience;\
  \ support land conservation and biodiversity efforts, including the 30 by 30 initiative;\
  \ maximize clean energy development and deployment. This program also provides support\
  \ under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Section 40803 Wildfire Risk\
  \ Reduction. The Joint Fire Science Program encourages interested parties to perform\
  \ research and studies pertaining to wildland fire and resource management, to enhance\
  \ decision-making ability of fire, fuels, natural resource, and land managers and\
  \ others to meet management objectives. This program solicits research and science\
  \ delivery proposals that respond to its announcements for proposals that seek information\
  \ on critical wildland fire and fuels issues, as well as related issues of post-fire\
  \ recovery, smoke management, and the human dimensions of fire."
