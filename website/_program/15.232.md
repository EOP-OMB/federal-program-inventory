objective: This program continues to advance the Administration’s priorities to to
  prioritize efforts to reduce climate pollution; support climate resilience; support
  land conservation and biodiversity efforts, including the 30 by 30 initiative; maximize
  clean energy development and deployment. This program also provides support under
  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Section 40803 Wildfire Risk Reduction.
  The Joint Fire Science Program encourages interested parties to perform research
  and studies pertaining to wildland fire and resource management, to enhance decision-making
  ability of fire, fuels, natural resource, and land managers and others to meet management
  objectives. This program solicits research and science delivery proposals that respond
  to its announcements for proposals that seek information on workforce development
  including Graduate Research Innovation (FRIN), the Fire Science Exchange Network
  (FSEN), and critical wildland fire and fuels management research needs.

results:
- description: No current data available.  Program accomplishments provided new information
    and tools to improve decision-making in wildland fire management. Program accomplishments
    include studies that benefit fire and resource management programs both directly
    and through the inherently interagency nature of many of the related projects.
    Projects have had direct benefit to, among others, fire management, Predictive
    Services, meteorologists, fuels analysts, intelligence officers, fire behavior
    analysts, fire specialists, fire planners, resource managers and State and local
    government leaders. Specific accomplishments include social barriers to implement
    prescribed fires and maintenance and restoration of sagebrush habitat. For the
    Joint Fire Science Program, the continued support of the regional consortia projects
    and the Fire and Smoke Model Evaluation Experiment (FASMEE) project.

- description: "JFSP Project 14-2-01-29 Fire-Adapted Communities on the Range: Alternative\
    \ Models of Wildfire Response. This project contributed new knowledge about a\
    \ model of community-based fire management that is growing in popularity and increasingly\
    \ viewed as a crucial, front-line strategy for protecting sage-grouse habitat\
    \ and the ranching industry (e.g., in state-level sage-grouse conservation efforts\
    \ and the 2015 Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy). We successfully\
    \ helped characterize and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the RFPA model\
    \ such that existing programs may be improved and future programs may benefit\
    \ from lessons learned. Other community-based fire management strategies are also\
    \ growing across the country, including prescribed burn councils and associations,\
    \ and public interest in better wildfire suppression is at an historic high following\
    \ the 2017 wildfire season. The primary implication for management and practice\
    \ is that such community-based approaches can offer significant assets to mitigation\
    \ and suppression efforts, particularly in “working lands” communities, but challenges\
    \ to the integration of informal and formal organizations must be proactively\
    \ recognized and managed. Policy makers and managers should also consider how\
    \ statutory basis, program design, and state agency roles shape community participation\
    \ and community-agency relationships.  \n\nJFSP Project 16-2-01-9 Towards improved\
    \ quantification and prediction of post-fire recovery in conifers. The benefits\
    \ of this research include improved quantification of landscape-scale burn severity\
    \ through biometrics such as net photosynthesis/net primary productivity, and\
    \ predictive models that will help land managers with prescribed- and wild-fire\
    \ planning. For example, the data produced from this quantification could serve\
    \ as the basis for quantitative vulnerability maps for land managers (Smith et\
    \ al. 2014) by identifying less vigorous stands that may be susceptible to secondary\
    \ mortality (such as insects and disease). This work builds upon completed and\
    \ ongoing laboratory research (Sparks et al. 2016, in review), and investigates\
    \ 5 relationships between increasing doses of fire radiative flux metrics (FRFD,\
    \ FRED) with growth and physiological metrics including leaf net photosynthesis.\
    \ This data will provide the foundation for future models of tree mortality and\
    \ surviving tree vigor. As FRE is strongly correlated with total energy release\
    \ from a fire (Freeborn et al. 2008), these models could be incorporated with\
    \ the energy release component (ERC, units: Btu ft-2 ), a National Fire Danger\
    \ Rating System (NFDRS) output that calculates the potential energy per unit area\
    \ based on fuel load and live/dead fuel moisture, to help predict future fire\
    \ effects such as tree mortality. Ultimately, the expected benefits will help\
    \ address the JFSP “post-fire recovery” topic area by improving: 1) our understanding\
    \ of physiological changes in trees post-fire based on fire intensity metrics,\
    \ and 2) our ability to quantify burn severity at landscape scales."

- description: 'JFSP funded 32 GRIN projects that support graduate students to enhance
    interaction with fire and fuels managers. Funded four projects to assess fuel
    breaks and fuel break systems, and funded three to reduce damages and losses to
    valued resources. The JFSP funds and provides oversight to a national collaborative
    of 15 regional wildland fire science exchanges: the Fire Science Exchange Network
    (FSEN). The FSEN provides the most relevant, current wildland fire science information
    to federal, state, local, tribal, and private stakeholders within ecologically
    similar regions. In Fiscal Year 2020 JFSP funded three FSEN projects via cooperative
    agreement.'

- description: 'JFSP projects are focused on continued support for the Fire Science
    Exchange Network (FSEN) and we anticipate funding four FSEN projects. The program
    will continue to fund graduate students through the Graduate Research Innovation
    (GRIN) program and anticipate funding 12 GRIN projects.


    JFSP research is focused on two main research areas.  Sources and distribution
    of human-caused ignitions and their impacts on wildfire and reducing damages and
    losses to valued resources from wildfire.  We anticipate funding five proposals
    in these two topic areas.'
  year: '2021'
- description: JFSP will be focused on continued support for the Fire Science Exchange
    Network (FSEN) and the Graduate Research Innovation (GRIN) program.  Research
    focus areas will be longevity of fuel treatment effectiveness under climate change,
    fuels treatment effectiveness across landscapes, pre-fire management actions for
    reducing post-fire hazards, and social factors that influence fire suppression
    and rehabilitation costs.

    \ focus areas will be accelerating science in fire-prone ecosystems, effective\
    \ fire communication and outreach, prescribed fire effects on water quality and\
    \ quantity, managing carbon emissions in ecosystems with deep organic soils, Social\
    \ equity and wildland fire impacts, and characterizing wildland fire risk in wildland-urban\
