objective: "The Homeland Security Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP) is established\
  \ to build State, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) capabilities to prevent,\
  \ protect against, respond to, and recover from major events, including threats\
  \ or acts of terrorism. This overarching programmatic goal of building state and\
  \ local capabilities will be achieved through various means and methods, each one\
  \ aimed at making achieving the National Preparedness Goal and furthering our collective\
  \ efforts to remain a safe and secure nation. Specific program activities anticipated\
  \ for achieving this goal will include, but will not be limited to: \n\u2022\tproduction\
  \ and dissemination of written products relating to emerging homeland security,\
  \ emergency management and public safety issues and established or model state homeland\
  \ security and emergency management efforts;\n\u2022\tproviding educational seminars,\
  \ training and workshops for apprising newly appointed Governor\u2019s Homeland\
  \ Security Advisors (HSAs) and Emergency Management Directors of federal homeland\
  \ security doctrine, best-practices and established principles; \n\u2022\tfacilitating\
  \ calls, meetings, or discussions amongst representatives from key stakeholder groups\
  \ on a regular basis which serve to share information, knowledge, experiences, and\
  \ practices relating to current and emerging homeland security, emergency management\
  \ and public safety issues; and, \n\u2022\tconvening trainings, workshops, and other\
  \ meeting opportunities designed to bring together in a common forum nationwide\
  \ Homeland Security Advisors, state, local and tribal Emergency Management Directors,\
  \ as well as other professional organizations in the public and private sectors\
  \ and to inform partners on the impacts of federal homeland security, emergency\
  \ management and public safety legislation, regulations and policies on the states.\n\
  Each recipient will conduct these specific activities to support either State Emergency\
  \ Management Directors, Homeland Security Advisors to further build SLTT capabilities.\
  \ An additional key purpose for the HSPTAP is that the program also furthers the\
  \ building of a national system of emergency management capabilities that can effectively\
  \ and efficiently utilize the full measure of the Nation's resources to respond\
  \ to catastrophic incidents, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and\
  \ other man-made emergencies or events. HSPTAP recipients will conduct activities\
  \ that bring together the collective perspectives of state and local elected officials\
  \ and the private sector to provide a broad-based sounding board on homeland security\
  \ issues for all national stakeholders. The program will serve to establish, provide,\
  \ and maintain a forum for organizations to exchange ideas, conduct targeted discussions,\
  \ as well as to provide technical assistance to governors\u2019 offices, associations\
  \ and organizations on all relevant homeland security policy areas. Finally, HSPTAP\
  \ will engage the recipient organizations which can work closely with FEMA to develop,\
  \ transfer, and institutionalize pertinent knowledge at the State and local level\
  \ for addressing current public policy challenges facing State EM Directors, HSAs\
  \ and other state and local emergency management officials. HSPTAP recipients, through\
  \ collaboration with FEMA and other national, regional, state and local entities,\
  \ will facilitate focused and enhanced communication and coordination among all\
  \ disciplines and levels of government to address the complex challenges of developing\
  \ and implementing homeland security policies and practices including: intelligence\
  \ sharing; State homeland security organization, structure and governance; communications\
  \ interoperability; critical infrastructure protection; and all hazards disaster\
  \ prevention, protection, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to include\
  \ areas of emergency management, homeland security, fire, law enforcement, Emergency\
  \ Management Services (EMS), agriculture, National Guard, emergency communications,\
  \ and public works. In sum, in addition to building state and local capabilities,\
  \ the activities conducted under the HSPTAP are structured to address the full spectrum\
  \ of mission areas, national priorities, and core capabilities outlined in the National\
  \ Preparedness System and are critical to achieving the National Preparedness Goal."
