objective: "Goals: \nThe goal of the BCJI is to reduce crime and improve community\
  \ safety as part of a comprehensive strategy to rebuild neighborhoods and spur revitalization.\
  \ Through a broad cross-sector partnership team, including neighborhood residents,\
  \ BCJI grantees target neighborhoods with persistent hot spots of violent and serious\
  \ crime and employ data-driven, cross-sector strategies to reduce crime and violence\
  \ and increase trust.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo achieve BCJI  program goals and objectives,\
  \ the fiscal agent must commit to accomplishing the following:\n•\tIdentify a neighborhood\
  \ with a concentration of crime hot spots which have for a period of time composed\
  \ a significant proportion of crime or types of crime;\n•\tEnsure meaningful engagement\
  \ of residents and other partners, including coordination in the development or\
  \ implementation of a comprehensive and coordinated strategic plan;\n•\tDevelop\
  \ and/or implement a plan that outlines a set of strategies that offers a continuum\
  \ of approaches to address crime drivers including enforcement, prevention, intervention,\
  \ and revitalization strategies with support from the BCJI training and technical\
  \ assistance provider;\n•\tDemonstrate commitment and a clear history of the partners,\
  \ including the local law enforcement agency and a research partner or team, to\
  \ support the data collection and analysis throughout the life of the grant;\n•\t\
  Demonstrate ability to hire and support a skilled lead site coordinator that will\
  \ oversee and facilitate coordination and collaboration among criminal justice and\
  \ service providers (e.g., by the formation of a diverse advisory board or cross-sector\
  \ partnership team to address an identified problem);\n•\tFacilitate, as appropriate,\
  \ collaboration with relevant local, state, or federal initiatives  located in,\
  \ adjacent, or overlapping the jurisdiction that addresses issues that relate to\
  \ the crime issues identified; and,\n•\tSupport the planning, implementation and\
  \ sustainment of the program through proactive program management tied to rigorous\
  \ research and data analysis, program assessment, and leverage other funding and\
  \ resources."

  year: '2018'
- description: "Since 2012, this program has provided funding to 83 of the most distressed\
    \ neighborhoods across the country, including urban, rural, and tribal communities.\
    \ Some accomplishments across the four core objectives include: \n\nCrime and\
    \ Offending:\n•\tPart I crimes in Philadelphia’s target area dropped from an average\
    \ of 61 per year to 46 per year between 2012 and 2015. Additionally, one year\
    \ after revitalization work was completed at one hotspot—the intersection of 34th\
    \ and Haverford—crime decreased 75 percent (from 168 incidents every 6 months\
    \ to 40) and there were no shootings.\n\n•\tCrime in the immediate area targeted\
    \ by the Flint, Michigan, CBCR effort dropped 20 percent from 2015 to 2016.  This\
    \ includes drug-related loitering and assaults and shootings. In one hotspot,\
    \ violent crime declined 16 percent and property crime declined 14 percent. In\
    \ a second hotspot along the same commercial corridor, violent crime declined\
    \ 14 percent and property crime declined 51 percent.\n\nEconomic Investment and\
    \ Revitalization:  \n•\tThe Sheriff’s Office of Alameda County, California, is\
    \ leading revitalization efforts to create more economic opportunities along a\
    \ vacant commercial corridor that has been a hotspot for criminal activity for\
    \ at least a decade by launching “Eden Night Live.” One of the main goals of Eden\
    \ Night Live is to help small businesses increase their local consumer base and\
    \ create opportunities for entrepreneurs, while creating a place where people\
    \ can feel connected to one another.\n\nSocial Cohesion and Community-Police Collaboration:\n\
    •\tIn Youngstown, Ohio, more than 500 volunteers, organized through 25 project\
    \ partners, volunteered to board up and clean a significant number of vacant properties\
    \ in the CBCR target area. Volunteers cleaned up and secured 71 vacant properties\
    \ and removed 206 tires, 800 cubic yards of illegally dumped debris, and 467 bags\
    \ of trash. The City of Youngstown also demolished seven abandoned, severely blighted\
    \ houses as part of the project.\n\nCost effectiveness and Sustainability:\n•\t\
    The Syracuse, New York, CBCR Program successfully created and implemented a Peacemaking\
    \ Center, training 36 community members to provide free community-based conflict\
    \ resolution to individuals referred by justice system stakeholders. The program’s\
    \ success helped garner three additional funding sources to support and expand\
    \ the program and staffing, which moved it from a neighborhood-based to a countywide\
    \ program. \n\nMore highlights of these sites’ work and results may be reviewed\
