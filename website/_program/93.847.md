objective: "(1) To promote extramural basic and clinical biomedical research that\
  \ improves the understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease and leads to improved\
  \ preventions, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes, digestive, and kidney diseases.\
  \  Programmatic areas within the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and\
  \ Kidney Diseases include diabetes, digestive, endocrine, hematologic, liver, metabolic,\
  \ nephrologic, nutrition, obesity, and urologic diseases.  Specific programs areas\
  \ of interest include the following: (a)  For diabetes, endocrine, and metabolic\
  \ diseases areas:  Fundamental and clinical studies including the etiology, pathogenesis,\
  \ prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of diabetes mellitus and its complications;\
  \ Normal and abnormal function of the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal,\
  \ and other hormone secreting glands; Hormonal regulation of bone, adipose tissue,\
  \ and liver; on fundamental aspects of signal transduction, including the action\
  \ of hormones, coregulators, and chromatin remodeling proteins; Hormone biosynthesis,\
  \ secretion, metabolism, and binding; and on hormonal regulation of gene expression\
  \ and the role(s) of selective receptor modulators as partial agonists or antagonists\
  \ of hormone action; and Fundamental studies relevant to metabolic disorders including\
  \ membrane structure, function, and transport phenomena and enzyme biosynthesis;\
  \ and basic and clinical studies on the etiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and\
  \ treatment of inherited metabolic disorders (such as cystic fibrosis).  (b)  For\
  \ digestive disease and nutrition areas:  Genetics and genomics of the GI tract\
  \ and its diseases; Genetics and genomics of liver/pancreas and diseases; Genetics\
  \ and genomics of nutrition; genetics and genomics of obesity; Bariatric surgery;\
  \ Clinical nutrition research; Clinical obesity research; Complications of chronic\
  \ liver disease; Fatty liver disease; Genetic liver disease; HIV and liver; Cell\
  \ injury, repair, fibrosis and inflammation in the liver; Liver cancer; Liver transplantation;\
  \ Pediatric liver disease; Viral hepatitis and infectious diseases; Gastrointestinal\
  \ and nutrition effects of AIDS; Gastrointestinal mucosal and immunology; Gastrointestinal\
  \ motility; Basic neurogastroenterology; Gastrointestinal development; Gastrointestinal\
  \ epithelial biology; Gastrointestinal inflammation; Digestive diseases epidemiology\
  \ and data systems;  Nutritional epidemiology and data systems; Autoimmune liver\
  \ disease; Bile, Bilirubin and cholestasis; Bioengineering and biotechnology related\
  \ to digestive diseases, liver, nutrition and obesity; Cell and molecular biology\
  \ of the liver; Developmental biology and regeneration; Drug-induced liver disease;\
  \ Gallbladder disease and biliary diseases; Exocrine pancreas biology and diseases;\
  \ Gastrointestinal neuroendocrinology; Gastrointestinal transport and absorption;\
  \ Nutrient metabolism; Pediatric clinical obesity; Clinical trials in digestive\
  \ diseases; Liver clinical trials; Obesity prevention and treatment; and Obesity\
  \ and eating disorders.   (c)  For kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases areas:\
  \  Studies of the development, physiology, and cell biology of the kidney; Pathophysiology\
  \ of the kidney; Genetics of kidney disorders; Immune mechanisms of kidney disease;\
  \ Kidney disease as a complication of diabetes; Effects of drugs, nephrotoxins and\
  \ environmental toxins on the kidney; Mechanisms of kidney injury repair; Improved\
  \ diagnosis, prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal\
  \ disease; Improved approaches to maintenance dialysis therapies; Basic studies\
  \ of lower urinary tract cell biology, development, physiology, and pathophysiology;\
  \ Clinical studies of bladder dysfunction, incontinence, pyelonephritis, interstitial\
  \ cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urolithiasis, and vesicoureteral reflux;\
  \ Development of novel diagnostic tools and improved therapies, including tissue\
  \ engineering strategies, for urologic  disorders;Research on hematopoietic cell\
  \ differentiation; metabolism of iron overload and deficiency; Structure, biosynthesis\
  \ and genetic regulation of hemoglobin; as well as Research on the etiology, pathogenesis,\
  \ and therapeutic modalities for the anemia of inflammation and chronic diseases.\
  \ \r\n(2)  To encourage basic and clinical research training and career development\
  \ of scientists during the early stages of their careers.  The Ruth L. Kirschstein\
  \ National Research Service Award (NRSA) funds basic and clinical research training,\
  \ support for career development, and the transition from postdoctoral biomedical\
  \ research training to independent research related to diabetes, digestive, endocrine,\
  \ hematologic, liver, metabolic, nephrologic, nutrition, obesity, and urologic diseases.\
  \ (3)  To expand and improve the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.\
  \  The SBIR Program aims to increase and facilitate private sector commercialization\
  \ of innovations derived from Federal research and development; to enhance small\
  \ business participation in Federal research and development; and to foster and\
  \ encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business\
  \ concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.\
  \ (4)  To utilize the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR\
  \ Program intends to stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation\
  \ through cooperative research and development carried out between small business\
  \ concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small\
  \ business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization\
  \ of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and\
  \ encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business\
  \ concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation."
