objective: The objective of the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP) is to ensure
  that noncitizens engaged in immigration removal proceedings and enrolled in the
  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Alternatives to Detention program have
  access to legal information and other critical services. CMPP service providers
  will provide case management, trafficking screening, legal orientation programs,
  and, as needed, mental health services, cultural orientation programs, connection
  to social services, and departure planning and reintegration services to noncitizens
  in immigration removal proceedings. The CMPP will enable the Department to determine
  whether CMPP services, delivered by nonprofits and/or local governments and overseen
  and managed by a National Board, are efficacious. For these purposes, efficacious
  means promoting compliance with immigration legal obligations, efficiencies within
  the immigration legal process, and other factors that are important for humanitarian
  reasons, including identifying victims of human trafficking and individuals potentially
  eligible for immigration relief.
