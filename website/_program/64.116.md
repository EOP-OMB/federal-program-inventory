- description: VR&E services include most independent living services, career counseling,
    medical referrals, and non-training evaluation services such as assistive technology
    evaluations. Through outreach and early intervention efforts, some VR&E participants
    are still on active duty and in the process of separating from the military. VR&E
    can assist Service members with a disability by providing evaluation, rehabilitation
    services, training, and case management. Service members are not eligible for
    subsistence allowance payments until they have completed their separation from
    the military and are considered a Veteran.
