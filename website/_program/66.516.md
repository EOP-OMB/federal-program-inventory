  quality of life, economic prosperity, and protection of the planet â€“ people, prosperity,
  and the planet. The P3 Program encourages a shift towards more environmentally benign
  products, processes, and systems. P3 encourages interdisciplinary collaborations
  across STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines to devise
  innovative solutions to environmental and public health challenges in the United
  States, including those in small, rural, tribal and/or underserved communities.
  Challenges from a wide range of categories will be considered. These include: Clean
  and Healthy Air; Clean and Safe Water; Safeguarding and Revitalizing Communities;
