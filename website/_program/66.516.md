objective: 'The P3 program supports research, development, and design of innovative
  projects that address real world challenges involving environmental protection and
  public health. The P3 competition highlights the use of scientific principles in
  creating innovative technology-based projects that achieve the mutual goals of improved
  quality of life, economic prosperity, and protection of the planet – people, prosperity,
  and the planet. The P3 Program encourages a shift towards more environmentally benign
  products, processes, and systems.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
  seeks applications proposing to take a holistic approach, grounded in research and
  innovation, to develop and demonstrate solutions to real world challenges. The People,
  Prosperity, and the Planet’s (P3) Program highlights the use of scientific principles
  in creating innovative technology-based projects that achieve the mutual goals of
  improved quality of life, economic prosperity and environmental protection. P3 encourages
  interdisciplinary collaborations across STEM (science, technology, engineering,
  and mathematics) disciplines to devise innovative solutions to environmental and
  public health challenges in the United States, including those in small, rural,
  tribal and/or underserved communities. Challenges from a wide range of categories
  will be considered. These include: Clean and Healthy Air; Clean and Safe Water;
  Safeguarding and Revitalizing Communities; and Ensuring Safety of Chemicals.'
