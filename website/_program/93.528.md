objective: "The National Forum cooperative agreement aligns state and federal efforts\
  \ by providing opportunities for state and territorial decision-makers to collaborate\
  \ on the development and implementation of innovative strategies and best practices\
  \ related to health workforce issues, health systems, and access to healthcare.\
  \ The purpose of the National Forum is to convene high level decision makers representing\
  \ state/territorial governors, their policy advisors, and state, federal, health\
  \ and human services providers, as well as private sector interests around issues\
  \ of importance to state and territorial governments. As such, HRSA\u2019s support\
  \ of the National Forum program will assist governors and key policy staff to develop\
  \ and implement innovative solutions to challenges facing the health care safety\
  \ net at the state and national level. This will further HRSA\u2019s goals for enhancing\
  \ service to the safety net population and supporting sustainability of programs.\
  \ The three core functions of the Cooperative Agreement are: 1) facilitate collaboration\
  \ among states, territories, federal partners and other key stakeholders to achieve\
  \ common goals; 2) encourage integration of public health practice, primary care\
  \ delivery systems and public health infrastructures; and 3) disseminate best practices\
  \ and lessons learned to other states, territories and key stakeholders through\
  \ various formats and mechanisms."
