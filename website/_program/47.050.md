objective: To strengthen and enhance the national scientific enterprise through the
  expansion of fundamental knowledge and increased understanding of the integrated
  Earth system through the support of basic research in the atmospheric, earth, and
  ocean sciences. Objectives include the discovery of new knowledge of the atmosphere
  from the sun to the Earth's surface over the entire spectrum of physical and chemical
  phenomena; a better understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological character
  of the Earth and the processes that govern its evolution; increased insight into
  the world's oceans, their composition, structure, behavior, and tectonics. Support
  is also provided for undergraduate student research, graduate and postdoctoral fellowships,
  facility enhancement, instrumentation, and laboratory equipment; and for research
  opportunities for women, minority, and disabled scientists and engineers.
