    Mental Health Collaboration Program provided  $18.6 million to support innovative
    cross-system collaboration for individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring
    mental health and substance abuse disorders who come into contact with the justice
    system. The program funds collaborative projects between criminal justice and
    mental health partners to plan, implement or expand a justice and mental health
    program.

    $900,000 was provided to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections to establish
    a statewide pilot program that partners with the appropriate agencies within the
    state. The initiative will establish a collaborative prison anti-recidivism effort
    to provide comprehensive care before, during, and after incarceration for persons
    with serious mental illness, with a goal of reducing recidivism.


    Through BJA’s Improving Justice and Mental Health Collaboration - Training and
    Technical Assistance to Grantees and the Field Program, $4.6 million was awarded
    to the Council of State Governments in Lexington, Kentucky, to provide training
    and technical assistance to law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies
    and their partner mental health and substance abuse authorities to reduce crime
    and recidivism associated with people with mental illnesses.
