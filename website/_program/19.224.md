  circumstances or conditions that are unanticipated or unusually difficult, but of
  high priority.  Activities include assistance worldwide for various nonproliferation

  of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and conventional weapons systems, and
  (b) the destruction of existing weapons, delivery systems, and production facilities.
