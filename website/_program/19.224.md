  U.S. Government to respond rapidly to nonproliferation and disarmament opportunities,
  circumstances or conditions that are unanticipated or unusually difficult, but of
  high priority.  Activities include assistance worldwide for various nonproliferation
  and disarmament projects that involve (a) efforts to halt the spread of weapons
  of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and conventional weapons systems, and
  (b) the destruction of existing weapons, delivery systems, and production facilities.
