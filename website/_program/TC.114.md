objective: The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures.
  In contrast, the Tax Code allowed educators in both public and private elementary
  and secondary schools, who worked at least 900 hours during a school year as a teacher,
  instructor, counselor, principal or aide, to subtract up to $300 of qualified expenses
  when determining their adjusted gross income (AGI).
