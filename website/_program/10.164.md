objective: 'Wholesale Farmers and Alternative Market Development works to improve
  market access for producers and develop new markets through its three main roles
  as a researcher, a convener, and a technical assistance provider. This work ensures
  that opportunities for U.S. food producers are readily available and communities
  are equipped to successfully grow and sell regionally produced foods, while also
  supporting increased access to locally produced foods.


  The Wholesale Market and Facility Design team provides technical assistance and
  support to stakeholders regarding the construction of new structures or the remodeling
  of existing ones. These facilities include wholesale markets, farmers markets, public
  markets, incubator kitchens, and food hubs, all of which are important parts of
  the national food distribution network. The facilities may be indoors or outdoors,
  a single building or an industrial complex.'
