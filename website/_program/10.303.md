objective: 'GENERAL: NIFA Integrated Programs provide support for integrated research,
  education, and extension activities. Integrated, multi-functional projects are particularly
  effective in addressing important agricultural issues through the conduct of problem-focused
  research that is combined with education and extension of knowledge to those in
  need of solutions. These activities address critical national, regional, and multi-state
  agricultural issues, priorities, or problems. Integrated Programs hold the greatest
  potential to produce and disseminate knowledge and technology directly to end users
  while providing for educational opportunities to assure agricultural expertise in
  future generations. See individual program Requests for Applications for additional
  information about the topics. SEVERAL PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED UNDER CFDA 10.303. SPECIFIC
  OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive
  Grants Program: See RFA for priority areas. (2) Integrated Research, Education,
  and Extension Competitive Grants Program: National Integrated Food Safety Initiative
  The purpose of the National Integrated Food Safety Initiative is to support food
  safety projects that demonstrate an integrated approach to solving problems in applied
  food safety research, education, or extension. Various models for integration of
  applied research, education, and extension will be considered for funding. Applications
  describing multi-state, multi-institutional, multidisciplinary, and multifunctional
  activities (and combinations thereof) are encouraged. Applicants are strongly encouraged
  to address at least two of the three functional areas of research, education, and
  extension (i.e., research and extension, research and education, or extension and
  education). (3) Integrated Research, Education, And Extension Competitive Grants
  Program: \(6) Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program:
  Methyl Bromide Transitions Program The goal of the Methyl Bromide Transitions (MBT)
  program is to support the discovery and implementation of practical pest management
  alternatives to methyl bromide uses or minimize methyl bromide emissions for which
  the United States is requesting critical use exemptions. The program is focused
  on integrated commercial or field scale research that targets short- to medium-term
  solutions. (7) Integrated Organic Program The purpose of the Integrated Organic
  Program is to solve critical organic agriculture issues, priorities, or problems
  through the integration of research, education, and extension activities. The Organic
  Transitions Program (ORG) funds the development and implementation of research,
  extension, and higher education programs to improve the competitiveness of organic
  producers and producers who are adopting organic practices. Funding opportunities
  for the ORG Program is included in the same Request for Applications (RFA) as the
  Organic Research and Extension Initiative (OREI). PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROGRAM DOES
  NOT FUND START UP BUSINESSES. (8) Regional Rural Development Centers (RRDCs): The
  RRDCs play a unique role in USDA''s service to rural America. They link the research
  and educational outreach capacity of the nation''s public universities with communities,
  local decision makers, entrepreneurs, families, and farmers and ranchers to help
  address a wide range of development issues. They collaborate on national issues
  that span regions-like e-commerce, the changing interface between rural, suburban,
  and urban places, and workforce quality and jobs creation. Each tailors programs
  to address particular needs in its region.'
