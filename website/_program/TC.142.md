objective: Under the reference tax law baseline, gifts and transfers are not treated
  as income to the recipients. In contrast, the normal tax method considers cash transfers
  from the Government as part of the recipientsâ€™ income, and thus, treats the exclusion
  for public assistance benefits under current law as a tax expenditure.
