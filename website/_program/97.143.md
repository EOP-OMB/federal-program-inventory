objective: The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS)
  grant program makes federal funds available to applicable states, U.S territories,
  federally recognized tribal governments, and local communities to plan for and implement
  sustainable cost-effective measures designed to reduce the risk to individuals and
  property from future natural hazards, while also reducing reliance on federal funding
  from future disasters. Only states, territories, or federally recognized tribal
  governments with projects identified by Congress in the appropriate year’s Appropriations
  Act are eligible to apply.

- description: "In FY2023, 89 subapplications were awarded for $207,924,462.75 federal\
    \ share  by the end of September 2023. With there only being one quarter since\
    \ awards were made, these subapplicants are working on their State-Local Agreements\
    \ before implementation of the grant project. PDM aims to implement projects that\
    \ reduce risks posed by natural hazards and reduce future losses, by funding priority\
    \ projects and activities. Priorities include risk reduction of both acute events\
    \ and chronic stressors, which are either observed or expected. To achieve these\
    \ goals, for FY23 PDM, the 89 subapplications that were awarded prioritize the\
    \ following types of \nactivities: infrastructure projects, those that mitigate\
    \ risk to lifelines, and projects proposed by applicants that reduce reliance\
    \ on federal disaster funding. FEMA will measure the percent of dollars invested\
    \ in these priorities, which will indicate that PDM projects expect to meet the\
    \ goal of reducing both risks posed by natural hazards and future losses."
