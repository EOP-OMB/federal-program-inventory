objective: 'The Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMLFPP) is a component
  of the Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP). FMLFPP supports the development,
  coordination and expansion of local and regional food systems through two competitive
  grant programs: (1) Farmers Market Promotion Program (FMPP) and (2) Local Food Promotion
  Program (LFPP). FMPP grants fund direct producer-to-consumer marketing projects
  such as farmers markets, community-supported agriculture programs, roadside stands,
  and agritourism. FMPP accepts Capacity Building, Community Development, Training,
  and Technical Assistance, and Turnkey Marketing and Promotion  grant project types
  to support domestic direct producer-to-consumer marketing channels. LFPP grants
  fund local and regional food business enterprises that serve as intermediaries to
  process, distribute, aggregate, and store locally or regionally produced food products.
  LFPP accepts Planning, Implementation, Farm to Institution and Turnkey Marketing
  and Promotion grant project types to support local and regional food businesses.'
