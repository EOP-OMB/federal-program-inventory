objective: 'The Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMLFPP) is a component
  of the Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP). FMLFPP supports the development,
  coordination and expansion of local and regional food systems through two competitive
  grant programs: (1) Farmers Market Promotion Program (FMPP) and (2) Local Food Promotion
  Program (LFPP). FMPP grants fund direct producer-to-consumer marketing projects
  such as farmers markets, community-supported agriculture programs, roadside stands,
  and agritourism. FMPP accepts Capacity Building, Community Development, Training,
  and Technical Assistance, and Turnkey Marketing and Promotion  grant project types
  to support domestic direct producer-to-consumer marketing channels. LFPP grants
  fund local and regional food business enterprises that serve as intermediaries to
  process, distribute, aggregate, and store locally or regionally produced food products.
  LFPP accepts Planning, Implementation, Farm to Institution and Turnkey Marketing
  and Promotion grant project types to support local and regional food businesses.'

- description: 'The Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMLFPP) has significantly
    bolstered local and regional food systems across the United States by funding
    projects that enhance direct-to-consumer marketing and support local food enterprises.
    Notable achievements include:

    Economic Impact: A comprehensive evaluation revealed that for every dollar invested
    through FMLFPP grants, $2.67 was generated in local and regional economies. This
    substantial return on investment underscores the program''s effectiveness in stimulating
    economic growth within communities.

    Support for New and Beginning Producers: FMLFPP has been instrumental in reducing
    barriers to entry for new agricultural businesses, assisting 989 new and beginning
    producers in accessing local or regional food markets. Additionally, nearly 8,000
    vendors received training in business licensing and financing, equipping them
    with essential skills for success.

    Expansion of Direct-to-Consumer Market Access: The program facilitated the establishment
    of numerous new direct producer-to-consumer market access points, including farmers
    markets, roadside stands, and community-supported agriculture programs. This expansion
    has increased consumer access to fresh, locally sourced foods and provided farmers
    with additional revenue streams.

    Enhancement of Business Capacity: FMLFPP funding enabled 68% of grant recipients
    to increase production or processing capabilities, including the development of
    value-added products. This growth has allowed businesses to diversify their offerings
    and meet the evolving demands of consumers.

    Strengthening of Community Connections: The program fostered relationships between
    businesses and local communities, with 90% of grant recipients establishing food
    chain linkages with schools, restaurants, regional planning groups, philanthropies,
    and food banks. These connections have been vital in building resilient local
    food systems.

    Through these initiatives, FMLFPP has played a crucial role in enhancing the viability
    of local food systems, supporting agricultural producers, and ensuring that consumers
    have access to fresh, healthy, and locally produced foods.'
