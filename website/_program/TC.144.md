objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated and
  deferred payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, the Social
  Security Equivalent Benefit paid to railroad retirees and the disabled is not generally
  subject to the income tax unless the recipientâ€™s modified gross income reaches a
  certain threshold under current law. See provision number 161, Social Security benefits
  for retired and disabled workers and spouses, dependents, and survivors, for a discussion
  of the threshold.
