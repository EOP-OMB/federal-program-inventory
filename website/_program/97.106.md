objective: "The DHS Secretary established the STC Program, managed through the Assistant\
  \ Secretary for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, to enhance the ability of\
  \ the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence\
  \ events utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose risk to homeland\
  \ security in high-risk urban areas.  Support to recipients includes assistance\
  \ in developing and integrating local or regional programs into a national detection\
  \ structure, guiding the development of Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) and standard\
  \ operating procedures, providing radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection equipment,\
  \ and providing training and exercise products to ensure detection is integrated\
  \ into day-to-day activities and that partners are proficient in the detection mission\
  \ area.  \nThe STC Goal and Objectives are: \nGoal - Develop/enhance sustainable\
  \ radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection capabilities among regional operational partners\n\
  Objectives - a) Assist state, local, tribal and territorial governments in developing\
  \ R/N detection and reporting capability; b) Establish information connectivity\
  \ to support radiological/nuclear alarm adjudication; c) Establish administrative\
  \ infrastructure to support a R/N detection program; d) Establish coordination mechanisms\
  \ between operational partners for steady state operations, enhanced steady state\
  \ operations and search operations.\n\n* DHS CWMD worked with the Federal Bureau\
  \ of Investigation and the Department of Energy to create the Domestic Detection\
  \ CONOPS to facilitate an effective \"whole of government\" response among mission\
  \ partners to detect and communicate about potential or actual threats involving\
  \ R/N materials within the United States.  DHS will provide the Domestic Detection\
  \ CONOPS to grant recipients as a basis for planning their regional CONOPS."
