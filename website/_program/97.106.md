  \ structure, guiding the development of Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) and standard\
  \ operating procedures, providing radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection equipment,\

  \ into day-to-day activities and that partners are proficient in the detection mission\
  \ area.  \nThe STC Goal and Objectives are: \nGoal - Develop/enhance sustainable\
  \ radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection capabilities among regional operational partners\n\
  Objectives - a) Assist state, local, tribal and territorial governments in developing\
  \ R/N detection and reporting capability; b) Establish information connectivity\
  \ to support radiological/nuclear alarm adjudication; c) Establish administrative\
  \ infrastructure to support a R/N detection program; d) Establish coordination mechanisms\

  \ of Investigation and the Department of Energy to create the Domestic Detection\
  \ CONOPS to facilitate an effective \"whole of government\" response among mission\
  \ partners to detect and communicate about potential or actual threats involving\
  \ R/N materials within the United States.  DHS will provide the Domestic Detection\
  \ CONOPS to grant recipients as a basis for planning their regional CONOPS."
