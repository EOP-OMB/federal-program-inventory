objective: Nondiscretionary funding under this authorization provides  support to
  State agencies for the collection and analysis of information on marine mammals
  that occur in the State's waters and interact with State managed fisheries and other
  marine resources. Information collected is used by the State and Federal governments
  to conserve marine mammals, address or resolve conflicts between marine mammals,
  fisheries and living marine resources, and to improve their understanding of the
  health of individual marine mammals as well as marine mammal populations.  Discretionary
  funds may be announced in the Federal Register under competitive programs to undertake
  research in subjects  which are relevant to the protection and conservation of marine
  mammals.
