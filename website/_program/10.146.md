objective: 'Throughout the pandemic USDA has provided vital support to farmers and
  ranchers experiencing a variety of hardships from natural disasters to supply chain
  disruptions. This includes over $23 billion dollars in program payments through
  the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to eligible producers to offset the
  financial impacts of the pandemic on American agriculture. FSA has made and continues
  to make a concerted effort to reach producers who are new to farming and new to
  working with USDA to ensure eligible producers receive the support they need. Many
  of the producers who participated in CFAP, particularly CFAP 2 due to increased
  support for specialty crops, were participating in a disaster program for the first
  time.


  Many producers are not aware that receiving funds from USDA through activities such
  as an EQIP contract, disaster payments, and the pending debt relief legislation
  payments creates a tax liability for their farm business. Often producers who receive
  financial support from USDA do not have the technical knowledge or understanding
  of how USDA program payments are treated for tax purposes or where to get support
  regarding tax questions. Taxpayer education has been a longstanding issue in the
  agricultural community. There is a dearth of preparers in rural areas, many producers
  are not knowledgeable about agricultural taxes, and producers do not have the knowledge
  or resources necessary to integrate tax planning into their farm financial planning
  process. USDA frequently works with historically underserved, beginning, and limited
  resource producers who lack access to legal and certified public accounting services
  or who are unfamiliar with agricultural accounting best practices.


  To address these issues the Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with a variety of cooperators
  through cooperative agreements to develop and deliver taxpayer education to producers
  and key stakeholders. These agreements will focus on addressing immediate needs
  of producers as well as their long-term needs, with the additional benefit of developing
  infrastructure to support rural taxpayer education and tax preparation for limited
  resource, beginning, and historically underserved farmers and ranchers.'
