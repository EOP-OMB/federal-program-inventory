objective: "The American Rescue Plan Act 2021, H.R. 1319, signed into law on March\
  \ 11, 2021, Section 1003 allocated funding to USDA for this work and leverages FSAâ€™s\
  \ cooperative agreement authority. This was followed by the August 16, 2022, Inflation\
  \ Reduction Act (IRA). Section 22006 of this law provided additional funding to\
  \ provide relief for distressed borrowers with certain FSA direct and guaranteed\
  \ loans and expedited assistance to agricultural operations at risk. \nThroughout\
  \ the pandemic USDA has provided vital support to farmers and ranchers experiencing\
  \ a variety of hardships from natural disasters to supply chain disruption. Many\
  \ producers are not aware that receiving funds from USDA through activities such\
  \ as an EQIP contract, disaster payments, and the pending debt relief legislation\
  \ payments creates a tax liability for their farm business. Taxpayer education has\
  \ been a longstanding issue in the agricultural community. USDA frequently works\
  \ with historically underserved, beginning, and limited resource producers who lack\
  \ access to legal and certified public accounting services or who are unfamiliar\
  \ with agricultural accounting best practices. To address these issues the Farm\
  \ Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture\
  \ (USDA), is partnering with cooperators to develop and deliver taxpayer education\
  \ to producers and key stakeholders. These agreements will support the creation\
  \ of educational ag tax resources for agricultural producers who receive USDA payments."
