results:
- description: The NWD Program supported 65 college-level degree programs as well
    as 164 training programs and activities designed to recruit and retain health
    professions students. These programs trained 6,549 students, including 2,886 students
    who graduated or completed their programs. Degree programs had 2,880 enrolled
    students this academic year, missing the target. This was primarily due to a new
    cohort of FY 2017 grantees being in a capacity-building year. In addition to providing
    support to students, NWD grantees partnered with 743 training sites during the
    academic year to provide 6,888 clinical training experiences to trainees across
    all programs. Approximately 48 percent of training sites were located in medically
    underserved communities and 33 percent were in primary care settings.
