objective: 'To enable Federally recognized Indian tribes to enter into agreements
  that would allow them to assume programs, services, functions, and activities (PSFA)
  (or portions thereof) that the IHS would otherwise provide for Indians because of
  their status as Indians. To accomplish this objective, the Indian Health Service
  (IHS) offers Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreements each year for: (1)
  additional tribes interested in participating in the IHS Tribal Self-Governance
  Program, and (2) existing Self-Governance Tribes that would like to plan for the
  assumption of new and/or expanded programs. The Planning Cooperative Agreements
  allow Tribes to gather information to determine the current types and extent of
  PSFA and funding levels available within its service areas and to plan for the types
  and extent of PSFA and funding to be made available to the tribe under a compact.
  The Negotiation Cooperative Agreements provide Tribes with additional funding to
  defray costs involved in and preparing to negotiate Self-Governance compacts pursuant
  to Title V of the ISDEAA.'
