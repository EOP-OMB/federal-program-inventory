objective: Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants support the development of comprehensive
  neighborhood Transformation Plans centered on the revitalization of a severely distressed
  public housing or HUD-assisted housing project. The Transformation Plan should integrate
  effective strategies to implement public and/or assisted housing revitalization,
  the coordination and design of supportive services, including educational opportunities
  for children, and neighborhood-level planning to improve a range of neighborhood
  assets. The Transformation Plan should be created as part of a collaborative planning
  process that involves neighborhood stakeholders and local governmental entities
  to build the necessary support to successfully implement the plan.
