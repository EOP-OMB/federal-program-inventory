objective: Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants support the development of comprehensive
  neighborhood Transformation Plans which are centered on the revitalization of a
  severely distressed public housing or HUD-assisted housing project. The Transformation
  Plan should integrate effective strategies for redevelopment of the targeted public
  and/or assisted housing project;  the provision  of supportive services for housing
  residents which address employment, health and educational opportunities; and initiatives
  which improve the range of neighborhood assets and promote economic development.
  The Transformation Plan should be created as part of a collaborative planning process
  that involves neighborhood stakeholders, local governmental entities and residents,
  and builds the necessary support to successfully implement the plan.
