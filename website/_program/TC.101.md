objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow deferral or exclusion from income for investments
  made within certain geographic regions. In contrast, the Tax Code allows the temporary
  deferral of the recognition of capital gain if reinvested prior to December 31,
  2026, in a qualifying opportunity fund which in turn invests in qualifying low-income
  communities designated as opportunity zones. For qualifying investments held at
  least 5 years, 10 percent of the deferred gain is excluded from income; this exclusion
  increases to 15 percent for investments held for at least 7 years. In addition,
  capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in a qualified opportunity
  fund held for at least 10 years are excluded from gross income.
