objective: The objective of the Low Income Household Water Assistance program is to
  meet unprecedented water services needs that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  This program is meant to be an emergency program that provides quick intervention
  to help the people facing the high water/wastewater costs compared to their income
  in resuming and/or maintaining their home water/wastewater services. The benefits
  are limited to households with low income, particularly those that pay a high proportion
  of household income for drinking water and wastewater services, by providing funds
  to owners or operators of public water systems or treatment works to reduce arrearages
  of and rates charged to eligible households. Low income is defined in the federal
  rules as the greater of 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or 60% of State Median
  Income; however, each recipient (state/tribe/territory) may prescribe a lower cut-off.
  Recipients can also decide a household’s eligibility based on categorical eligibility
  of a household member, meaning someone in the household is already receiving another
  type of qualifying public assistance such as from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
  Program (LIHEAP). The intent to is provide financial assistance to cover water,
  wastewater and related services and fees. The priority is to provide assistance
  first and foremost to households that face the most immediate need—households whose
  services are already disconnected. The benefit payment and/or interventions shall
  be sufficient to ensure restoration of the water/wastewater services. The benefits
  can pay any relevant arrearage (past due amount) that is preventing service from
  being reconnected, as well as any related late fee, reconnection fee, penalty, etc.,
  that is billed in normal course of billing by the water/wastewater provider to any
  household that has a past due balance. The last priority for assistance is for households
  that have service and only need help with current bills, e.g., do not have past
  due balances.
