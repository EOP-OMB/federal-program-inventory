objective: "The objective of the Low Income Household Water Assistance program is\
  \ to meet unprecedented water services needs that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.\
  \ This program is meant to be an emergency program that provides quick intervention\
  \ to help the people facing the high water/wastewater costs compared to their income\
  \ in resuming and/or maintaining their home water/wastewater services. The benefits\
  \ are limited to households with low income, particularly those that pay a high\
  \ proportion of household income for drinking water and wastewater services, by\
  \ providing funds to owners or operators of public water systems or treatment works\
  \ to reduce arrearages of and rates charged to eligible households. Low income is\
  \ defined in the federal rules as the greater of 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines\
  \ or 60% of State Median Income; however, each recipient (state/tribe/territory)\
  \ may prescribe a lower cut-off. Recipients can also decide a household\u2019s eligibility\
  \ based on categorical eligibility of a household member, meaning someone in the\
  \ household is already receiving another type of qualifying public assistance such\
  \ as from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The intent to\
  \ is provide financial assistance to cover water, wastewater and related services\
  \ and fees. The priority is to provide assistance first and foremost to households\
  \ that face the most immediate need\u2014households whose services are already disconnected.\
  \ The benefit payment and/or interventions shall be sufficient to ensure restoration\
  \ of the water/wastewater services. The benefits can pay any relevant arrearage\
  \ (past due amount) that is preventing service from being reconnected, as well as\
  \ any related late fee, reconnection fee, penalty, etc., that is billed in normal\
  \ course of billing by the water/wastewater provider to any household that has a\
  \ past due balance. The last priority for assistance is for households that have\
  \ service and only need help with current bills, e.g., do not have past due balances."
