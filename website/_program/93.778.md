objective: To provide financial assistance to States for payments of medical assistance
  on behalf of cash assistance recipients, children, pregnant women, and the aged
  who meet income and resource requirements, and other categorically-eligible groups.
  In certain States that elect to provide such coverage, medically-needy persons,
  who, except for income and resources, would be eligible for cash assistance, may
  be eligible for medical assistance payments under this program. Financial assistance
  is provided to States to pay for Medicare premiums, copayments and deductibles of
  qualified Medicare beneficiaries meeting certain income requirements. More limited
  financial assistance is available for certain Medicare beneficiaries with higher
  incomes.
