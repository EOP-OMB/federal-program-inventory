objective: 'The objectives of the MaryLee Allen Promoting Safe and Stable Families
  Program (PSSF) are: 1) to prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through
  the provision of supportive family services; 2) to assure children''s safety within
  the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, when
  the family''s problems can be addressed effectively; 3) to address the problems
  of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification
  may occur in a safe and stable manner; 4) to support adoptive families by providing
  support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their
  children. To accomplish these objectives, recipients (state, territory, and tribal
  child welfare agencies) will develop or expand and operate coordinated programs
  of community-based family support services, family preservation services, family
  reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services. In addition,
  a portion of funds is reserved for separate formula awards for states and territories
  to support monthly caseworker visits with children who are in foster care. A small
  proportion of appropriated funds are reserved for research, evaluation, and technical
  assistance, which may be awarded competitively through contracts or discretionary
  awards. In addition, funds are used to make formula awards to develop kinship navigator
  programs.'
