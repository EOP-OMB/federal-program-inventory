objective: "The objectives of the MaryLee Allen Promoting Safe and Stable Families\
  \ Program (PSSF) are: 1) to prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through\
  \ the provision of supportive family services; 2) to assure children's safety within\
  \ the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated,\
  \ when the family's problems can be addressed effectively; 3) to address the problems\
  \ of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification\
  \ may occur in a safe and stable manner; 4) to support adoptive families by providing\
  \ support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their\
  \ children.  This is accomplished through the issuance of awards to child welfare\
  \ agencies in states, territories, and eligible Indian tribes to serve families\
  \ at risk or in crisis, to develop or expand and operate coordinated programs of\
  \ community-based family support services, family preservation services, family\
  \ reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services. \n\nIn addition,\
  \ a portion of funds is reserved for separate formula awards for states and territories\
  \ to support monthly caseworker visits with children who are in foster care. A small\
  \ proportion of appropriated funds are reserved for research, evaluation, and technical\
  \ assistance, which may be awarded competitively through contracts or discretionary\
  \ awards."
