objective: Under the baseline tax system, employer contributions to Social Security
  represent labor cost and are deductible expenses. Under current law, however, certain
  employers are allowed a tax credit, instead of a deduction, against taxes paid on
  tips received from customers in connection with the providing, delivering, or serving
  of food or beverages for consumption. The tip credit equals the full amount of the
  employer’s share of FICA taxes paid on the portion of tips, when added to the employee’s
  non-tip wages, in excess of $5.15 per hour. The credit is available only with respect
  to FICA taxes paid on tips.
