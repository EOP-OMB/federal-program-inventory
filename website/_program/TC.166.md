objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law, the
  interest earned on general obligation bonds issued by State and local governments
  to finance housing for veterans is excluded from taxable income.
