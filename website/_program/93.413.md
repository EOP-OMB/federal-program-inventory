objective: The State Flexibility to Stabilize the Market Cycle I and II Grant Programs
  will provide a funding source to enhance the role of states in the implementation
  and planning for several of the Federal market reforms and consumer protections
  under Part A of Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). The State
  Flexibility to Stabilize the Market Grants will provide states with the opportunity
  to ensure their laws, regulations, and procedures are in line with Federal requirements,
  and enhance the statesâ€™ ability to effectively regulate their respective health
  insurance markets through innovative measures that support the pre-selected market
  reforms and consumer protections under Part A of Title XXVII of the PHS Act.
