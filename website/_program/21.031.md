objective: "Section 3301 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), Public Law\
  \ No. 117-2 (March 11, 2021), reauthorized and amended the Small Business Jobs Act\
  \ of 2010, codified at 12 U.S.C. \xA7 5701 et seq., to permit Treasury to provide\
  \ $9.5 billion to establish the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Capital\
  \ Program and up to $500 million for technical assistance (TA) as a response to\
  \ the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the SSBCI Capital Program,\
  \ Treasury allocates funds to states of the United States, the District of Columbia,\
  \ territories, eligible municipalities, and Tribal governments (eligible jurisdictions)\
  \ for small business financing programs, which includes loan participation, loan\
  \ guarantee, collateral support, venture equity, and capital access programs. Under\
  \ Section 3003(c)(5) of the Small Business Jobs Act, as amended, SSBCI Capital Program\
  \ funding is not considered financial assistance for purposes of subtitle V of title\
  \ 31, United States Code. The SSBCI TA Grant Program provides $200 million in technical\
  \ assistance funding for states, the District of Columbia, and territories that\
  \ submitted a complete application for the SSBCI Capital Program by February 11,\
  \ 2022, and Tribal governments that submitted a complete application for the SSBCI\
  \ Capital Program by September 1, 2022. These jurisdictions are the eligible recipients\
  \ of the SSBCI TA Grant Program. \n\nThe SSBCI TA Grant Program is intended to provide\
  \ funds to eligible recipients to provide legal, accounting, and financial advisory\
  \ services either directly or through a contractor to very small businesses (VSB)\
  \ and business enterprises owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged\
  \ individuals (SEDI-owned businesses). The primary goal of the SSBCI TA Grant Program\
  \ is to help VSB and SEDI-owned businesses meaningfully apply and participate in\
  \ the SSBCI Capital Program or another Federal or jurisdiction program that supports\
  \ small businesses. Eligible recipients may apply to Treasury for a portion of the\
  \ SSBCI TA Grant Program funding. Eligible states, the District of Columbia, and\
  \ territories must have submitted  TA application no later than October 14, 2022;\
  \ Tribal governments have until October 27, 2023, to submit TA applications. Treasury\
  \ has issued SSBCI TA Grant Program Guidelines dated April 28, 2022."
