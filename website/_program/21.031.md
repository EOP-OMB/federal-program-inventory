objective: "Section 3301 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), Public Law\
  \ No. 117-2 (March 11, 2021), reauthorized and amended the Small Business Jobs Act\
  \ of 2010SSBCI statute, codified at 12 U.S.C. \xA7 5701 et seq., to provide funding\
  \ for (1) the SSBCI Capital Program and (2) technical assistance (TA) to support\
  \ eligible small businesses applying for the SSBCI Capital Program and other federal\
  \ or other jurisdiction programs that support small businesses. \n\nThe SSBCI Formula\
  \ TA Grant Program provides $200 million in formula grants for technical assistance\
  \ funding for states, territories, the District of Columbia, and Tribal governments\
  \ (collectively, \u201Cjurisdictions\u201D) that submitted complete and timely applications\
  \ for the SSBCI Capital Program. These jurisdictions are the eligible recipients\
  \ under the SSBCI Formula TA Grant Program.\n\nThe SSBCI Formula TA Grant Program\
  \ is intended to provide funds to eligible recipients to provide legal, accounting,\
  \ and financial advisory services either directly or through legal, accounting,\
  \ or financial advisory firms to very small businesses (VSB) and business enterprises\
  \ owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SEDI-owned\
  \ businesses), as those terms are defined in SSBCI guidance. The primary goal of\
  \ the SSBCI Formula TA Grant Program is to help VSBs and SEDI-owned businesses meaningfully\
  \ apply and participate in the SSBCI Capital program or other Federal or other jurisdiction\
  \ programs that support small businesses. Eligible recipients may apply to Treasury\
  \ for a portion of the SSBCI Formula TA Grant program funding. The deadline for\
  \ eligible states, the District of Columbia, and territories to submit a Formula\
  \ TA application has passed; Tribal governments have until October 27, 2023, to\
  \ submit Formula TA applications. Treasury issued SSBCI Formula TA Grant Program\
  \ Guidelines dated April 28, 2022.\n\nThe SSBCI Formula TA Grant Program is related\
  \ to and supports the SSBCI Capital Program and the SSBCI Competitive TA Grant Program.\
  \ Under the SSBCI Capital Program, Treasury allocates funds to jurisdictions for\
  \ small business financing programs, which includes loan participation, loan guarantee,\
  \ collateral support, venture equity, and capital access programs. Under Section\
  \ 3003(c)(5) of the SSBCI statute as codified at 31 U.S.C. 5702(c)(5), SSBCI Capital\
  \ Program funding is not considered financial assistance for purposes of subtitle\
  \ V of title 31, United States Code."
