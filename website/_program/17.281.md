- description: DWTAT funds are used to provide technical assistance and transition
    to full WIOA implementation. For instance, this fund source has been used to support
    the Workforce Integrated Performance System (WIPS), State Wage Interchange System
    (SWIS), and Common Reporting Information System (CRIS), as well as technical assistance
    contracts and the Workforce IT Support Center. DWTAT funds are generally awarded
    through contracts and range from very small, targeted activities of just over
    $6,000 to much larger projects of approximately $3.5 million for the year; ETA
    awards approximately $11 million per year in DWTAT projects.

- description: 'In Fiscal Year 2021, the Employment and Training Administration published
    a solicitation to establish a Technical Assistance (TA) Collaborative to provide
    effective and efficient delivery of technical assistance to the public workforce
    system to promote the continuous improvement of services and outcomes provided
    to job seekers and employers. The desired result of the TA Collaborative is to
    establish a comprehensive and coordinated approach to improving services and outcomes
    of the public workforce system.




    In Fiscal Year 2022, ETA awarded a $3.5 million cooperative agreement to Safal
    Partners LLC to establish a Workforce System Technical Assistance Collaborative
    that will facilitate peer learning and information sharing, and provide access
    to subject matter experts to help jobseekers obtain employment and employers hire
    and retain skilled workers.   The funding supports a coordinated approach to technical
    assistance to help workforce boards and operators deliver quality services.  Safal
    will partner with the National Association of Workforce Boards, the National Association
    of Workforce Development Professionals and Third Sector Capital Partners to form
    the collaborative.  The Collaborative will assist workforce boards and others
    in the workforce system in implementing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
    Act (WIOA) programs and in achieving equity in service delivery and outcomes for
    people of color and historically marginalized populations, including individuals
    with disabilities.'
  year: '2022'
- description: 'In Fiscal Year 2022, ETA awarded a $3.5 million cooperative agreement
    to Safal Partners in FY 2022 to establish a Workforce System Technical Assistance
    Collaborative; in FY 2023, the Collaborative began work to identify needs or challenges
    being faced by the workforce system and developing a range of technical assistance
    to address needs, both for individual states or local areas but also for the broader
    workforce system.  The Safal team and their partners developed an online community
    of practice called “Next Level Now” on ETA’s technical assistance website, www.workforceGPS.org.
    This community serves as a hub for delivering strategic, short- and long-term
    technical assistance to the public workforce system and partners, assisting them
    at the state and local level as they improve services, quality, and outcomes for
    jobseekers and employers. In addition to developing and disseminating field-requested
    TA tools and resources, the NLN Collaborative facilitates peer learning opportunities
    and information sharing, makes subject matter experts accessible to increase efficacy
    and performance, and offers assistance in applying evidence-based practices for
    all users.


    In this first year of the NLN Collaborative, activities have included developing
    and presenting 11 webinars on a range of topics based on requested topics or identified
    challenges in the workforce system, including outreach and messaging, designing
    and implementing equitable workforce strategies, effective partnerships, and serving
    returning citizens following incarceration.'
