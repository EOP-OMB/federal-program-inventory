objective: 'To use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older to provide technical
  assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental agencies for projects of pollution
  prevention, abatement, and control to achieve the Agency''s goals of Clean Air;
  Clean and Safe Water; Land Preservation and Restoration; Healthy Communities and
  Ecosystems; and Compliance and Environmental Stewardship.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The Environmental Programs Assistance Act
  of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-313) authorized the Administrator of the EPA "to make grants
  to, or enter into cooperative agreements with private, nonprofit organizations designated
  by the Secretary of Labor under Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965." These
  cooperative agreements are to utilize the talents of older Americans in temporary,
  full time or part time positions "providing technical assistance to Federal, State,
  and local environmental agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement,
  and control." "Technical assistance" may include any activity performed for the
  EPA in support of its projects ranging from inspections of underground storage tanks,
  to support for a Headquarters staff office. This allows for the coverage of all
  types of SEE program positions from professional to clerical. Annual funding priorities
  are not established at the SEE program level. Rather, Senior Resource Officials
  from the participating 65 program offices establish priorities requiring SEE program
  support.'
