objective: To use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older to provide technical
  assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental agencies for projects of pollution
  prevention, abatement, and control to achieve the Agency's goals of Clean Air; Clean
  and Safe Water; Land Preservation and Restoration; Healthy Communities and Ecosystems;
  and Compliance and Environmental Stewardship. The Environmental Programs Assistance
  Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-313) authorizes the Administrator of the EPA "to make grants
  to, or enter into cooperative agreements with private, nonprofit organizations designated
  by the Secretary of Labor under Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965." In
  FY 2025, these cooperative agreements will continue to utilize the talents of older
  Americans in temporary, full time or part time positions "providing technical assistance
  to Federal, State, and local environmental agencies for projects of pollution prevention,
  abatement, and control." "Technical assistance" may include any activity performed
  for the EPA in support of its projects ranging from inspections of underground storage
  tanks, to support for a Headquarters staff office. This allows for the coverage
  of all types of SEE program positions from professional to clerical. Annual funding
  priorities are not established at the SEE program level. Rather, Senior Resource
  Officials from the participating 45 program offices establish priorities requiring
  SEE program support.
