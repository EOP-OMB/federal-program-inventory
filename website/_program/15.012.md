objective: "The NPS Centennial Act mandates parks to “use a broad program of the highest\
  \ quality interpretation and education,” and to “collaborate with other Federal\
  \ and non-Federal public and private agencies, organizations, or institutions for\
  \ the purposes of developing, promoting, and making available educational opportunities\
  \ related to resources of the System and programs.”  \n\nThe collaboration between\
  \ the NPS and Outdoor Schools are highly effective in promoting field-science and\
  \ stewardship through delivering on-site day use and residential environmental education\
  \ programs. Outdoor Schools work closely with universities, K-12 schools, professional\
  \ societies, and diverse research and educational groups on standards and delivery\
  \ methods."
