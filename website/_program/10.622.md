objective: The objective of FFO is to complement existing food assistance programming,
  which principally use row crops and vegetable oils, with commodities not commonly
  used in food assistance, in order to better understand how these can be integrated
  into existing programming streams in a cost-efficient manner, with the expectation
  that this will improve nutritional outcomes for program beneficiaries.
