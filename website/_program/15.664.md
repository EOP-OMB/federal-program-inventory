objective: 'The FWS established this assistance listing to be used: 1) temporarily
  by new financial assistance programs for awards needing to be issued immediately
  and before a standalone assistance listing can be established, and 2) to assign
  to awards providing support for ad hoc activities and projects unrelated to any
  other FWS assistance listing. Activities under this program support the conservation
  of the Nation’s natural resources and may include congressionally directed, externally
  funded, unsolicited, or ad hoc support for land management, research, data collection
  and analysis, training, award competitions, fellowships, contributions to intergovernmental
  and multinational councils, committees, and working groups, and emergency response
  activities.'
