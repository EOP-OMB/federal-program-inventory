objective: "NASA’s journeys have propelled technological \nbreakthroughs, pushed the\
  \ frontiers of scientific research, and expanded our understanding of the universe.\
  \ These accomplishments, and those to come, share a common genesis: education in\
  \ STEM. NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement (OSTEM) delivers tools for young Americans\
  \ and educators to learn and succeed. \nOSTEM seeks to: (1) create unique opportunities\
  \ for students and the public to contribute to NASA’s work in exploration and discovery,\
  \ (2) build a diverse future STEM workforce by engaging students in authentic learning\
  \ experiences with NASA people, content, and facilities, and (3) strengthen public\
  \ understanding by enabling powerful connections to NASA’s mission and work."
