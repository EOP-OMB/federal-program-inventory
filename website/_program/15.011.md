objective: 'The Experienced Services Program (ESP) will provide support to the NPS

  ESP participants will provide technical assistance and support to the NPS in the
  development and execution of projects that benefit the general public and provide
  support to NPS employees. This program will provide opportunities to qualified individuals
  55 years of age and older, who have specific technical skills and abilities not
  available or underrepresented at current NPS staffing levels. The ESP participants
  will not replace or displace current NPS employees.'
