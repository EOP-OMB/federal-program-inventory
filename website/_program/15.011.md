objective: 'The Experienced Services Program (ESP) will provide support to the National
  Park Service (NPS) on natural and cultural resource conservation projects that enable
  the agency to carry out its mission. Special emphasis will be placed on projects
  that improve the maintenance of our national park resources and enhance the visitor
  experience.


  ESP participants will provide technical assistance and support to the NPS in the
  development and execution of projects that benefit the general public and provide
  support to NPS employees. This program will provide opportunities to qualified individuals
  55 years of age and older, who have specific technical skills and abilities not
  available or underrepresented at current NPS staffing levels. The ESP participants
  will not replace or displace current NPS employees.'

    \ task agreements each, supporting several aspects of park operations, from finance\

    \ the students during the school year and during summer programs. These enrollees\
    \ have skills ranging from stone masonry to video production.\nNew initiatives:\

    \ to accomplish the necessary updates to fire management plans that are due soon."
