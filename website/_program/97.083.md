objective: "The goal of the SAFER Grant Program is to assist local fire departments\
  \ with staffing and deployment capabilities in order to respond to emergencies and\
  \ assure that communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards.\
  \ Local fire departments accomplish this by improving staffing and deployment capabilities,\
  \ so they may more effectively and safely respond to emergencies. With enhanced\
  \ staffing levels, recipients should experience a reduction in response times and\
  \ an increase in the number of trained personnel assembled at the incident scene.\
  \ The authorizing authority for the program is Section 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention\
  \ and Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-498, as amended (15 U.S.C § 2229a). The\
  \ SAFER Program directly supports Goal 3 of the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan to\
