objective: 'The State of Good Repair Program (49 U.S.C. 5337) provides formula funding
  to assist in financing capital projects for existing fixed guideway systems (including
  rail, bus rapid transit, and passenger ferries) and high intensity motorbus systems
  (buses operating in high-occupancy vehicle [HOV] lanes) to maintain public transportation
  systems in a state of good repair and to ensure public transit operates safely,
  efficiently, reliably, and sustainably so that communities can offer balanced transportation
  choices that helps to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and encourage economic
  development. Capital projects must be in a Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan and
  this funding source can be used to develop a Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan.


  The Competitive Rail Vehicle Replacement Grant (49 U.S.C. 5337(f)) is a discretionary
