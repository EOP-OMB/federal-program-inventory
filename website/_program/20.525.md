objective: 'The State of Good Repair Program (49 U.S.C. 5337) provides formula funding
  to assist in financing capital projects for existing fixed guideway systems (including
  rail, bus rapid transit, and passenger ferries) and high intensity motorbus systems
  (buses operating in high-occupancy vehicle [HOV] lanes) to maintain public transportation
  systems in a state of good repair and to ensure public transit operates safely,
  efficiently, reliably, and sustainably so that communities can offer balanced transportation
  choices that helps to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and encourage economic
  development. Capital projects must be in a Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan and
  this funding source can be used to develop a Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan.


  The Competitive Rail Vehicle Replacement Grant (49 U.S.C. 5337(f)) is a discretionary
  grant program to assist in financing the replacement of rail rolling stock.'

- description: The State of Good Repair program provided funds to 61 capital projects
    in FY 2021 as of June 14, 2021.  The capital projects include maintaining, rehabilitating
    and replacing rail tracks, stations, facilities, and vehicles.  For example, the
    Pacific Surfliner Corridor Rehabilitation and Service Reliability project provided
    $31.8 for structures and grade crossings in Ventura County and northern Los Angeles
    County on infrastructure used by Amtrak intercity service, Metrolink commuter
    service, and BNSF freight service. Work for member agency Ventura County Transportation
    Commission includes track, tie, ballast, and culvert replacements, grade crossing
    rehabilitation, and tunnel track and structure replacements.  As a result of this
    funding there will be reduced trip times, increased  reliability, and improvements
    in safety by reducing need for slow orders and conflicts at grade crossings in
    the corridor.
