objective: 'The Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Program''s goal is to stimulate
  and support scientific and engineering research that advances EPA''s mission to
  protect human health and the environment. It is a competitive, peer-reviewed, extramural
  research program that provides access to the nation''s best scientists and engineers
  in academic and other nonprofit research institutions. STAR funds research on the
  environmental and public health effects of air quality, environmental changes, water
  quality and quantity, hazardous waste, toxic substances, and pesticides.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: The STAR Program will fund the highest quality
  research in the following research areas: 1) Air, climate, and energy research to
  improve air quality, address the causes and consequences of climate change, and
  protect public health and the environment.  2) Safe and sustainable water resources
  research and scientific analyses to innovatively and economically support safe and
  adequate supplies of water—protecting people’s health and livelihood while restoring
  and maintaining watersheds and aquatic ecosystems and guiding innovative, cost-effective
  solutions to meet current, emerging, and long-term water resource challenges for
  complex chemical and biological contaminants. 3) Sustainable and healthy communities
  research that supports priorities related to advancing remediation and restoration
  of contaminated sites, materials management and beneficial reuse of waste, and integrated
  systems approaches to building healthy and resilient communities. This research
  will help to empower communities to make scientifically-informed decisions. 4) Chemical
  safety for sustainability research that addresses the pressing environmental and
  health challenges associated with a lack of sufficient information on chemicals
  needed to make informed, risk-based decisions. Research will meet the health and
  environmental protection goals of the Agency as well as partners including states
  and Tribes, by supporting transformative research leading to improved science-based
  approaches that build broader understanding of biology, chemical toxicity, and exposure.  Please
  check the EPA website: https://www.epa.gov/research-grants for an updated listing
  of all solicitations.'
