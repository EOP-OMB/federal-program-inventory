objective: "The Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Program's goal is to stimulate and\
  \ support scientific and engineering research that advances EPA's mission to protect\
  \ human health and the environment. It is a competitive, peer-reviewed, extramural\
  \ research program that provides access to the nation's best scientists and engineers\
  \ in academic and other nonprofit research institutions. STAR funds research on\
  \ the environmental and public health effects of air quality, environmental changes,\
  \ water quality and quantity, hazardous waste, toxic substances, and pesticides.\n\
  \nFunding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: The STAR Program will fund the highest quality\
  \ research in the following research areas: 1) Air, climate, and energy research\
  \ to improve air quality, address the causes and consequences of climate change,\
  \ and protect public health and the environment.  2) Safe and sustainable water\
  \ resources research and scientific analyses to innovatively and economically support\
  \ safe and adequate supplies of water\u2014protecting people\u2019s health and livelihood\
  \ while restoring and maintaining watersheds and aquatic ecosystems and guiding\
  \ innovative, cost-effective solutions to meet current, emerging, and long-term\
  \ water resource challenges for complex chemical and biological contaminants. 3)\
  \ Sustainable and healthy communities research that supports priorities related\
  \ to advancing remediation and restoration of contaminated sites, materials management\
  \ and beneficial reuse of waste, and integrated systems approaches to building healthy\
  \ and resilient communities. This research will help to empower communities to make\
  \ scientifically-informed decisions. 4) Chemical safety for sustainability research\
  \ that addresses the pressing environmental and health challenges associated with\
  \ a lack of sufficient information on chemicals needed to make informed, risk-based\
  \ decisions. Research will meet the health and environmental protection goals of\
  \ the Agency as well as partners including states and Tribes, by supporting transformative\
  \ research leading to improved science-based approaches that build broader understanding\
  \ of biology, chemical toxicity, and exposure.  Please check the EPA website: https://www.epa.gov/research-grants\
  \ for an updated listing of all solicitations."
