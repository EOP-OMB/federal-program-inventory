objective: "The Farm Storage Facility Loan (FSFL) Program provides low-interest financing\
  \ for producers to build, upgrade, or acquire farm storage and handling facilities,\
  \ storage and handling equipment and trucks. The following commodities are eligible\
  \ for on-farm storage, drying and handling equipment: corn, grain sorghum, rice,\
  \ soybeans, oats, peanuts, wheat, barley, or minor oilseeds harvested as whole grain;\
  \ corn, grain sorghum, wheat, oats or barley harvested as other-than-whole grain;\
  \ pulse crops (lentils, chickpeas and dry peas); hay; honey; renewable biomass;\
  \ fruits (includes nuts) and vegetables - cold storage facilities; aquaculture (excluding\
  \ systems that maintain live animals through uptake and discharge of water); floriculture;\
  \ hops; milk; rye; meat and poultry (unprocessed); eggs; cheese, butter and yogurt.\
  \ The loan must be approved by the local FSA state or county committee before any\
  \ site preparation, construction, and/or acquisition can be started. All loan requests\
  \ are subject to an environmental evaluation. Accepting delivery of equipment, starting\
  \ any site preparation, or construction before loan approval, may impede the successful\
  \ completion of an environmental evaluation and may adversely affect loan eligibility.\r\
  \n\r\nThe SSFL program provides loans to processors of domestically produced sugarcane\
  \ and sugar beets for the construction or upgrading of storage and handling facilities\
  \ for raw sugars and refined sugars."
