objective: 'The Farm Storage Facility Loan (FSFL) Program provides low-interest financing
  for producers to build, upgrade, or acquire farm storage and handling facilities,
  storage and handling equipment and trucks. The following commodities are eligible
  for on-farm storage, drying and handling equipment: corn, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans,
  oats, peanuts, wheat, barley, or minor oilseeds harvested as whole grain; corn,
  grain sorghum, wheat, oats or barley harvested as other-than-whole grain; pulse
  crops (lentils, chickpeas and dry peas); hay; honey; renewable biomass; fruits (includes
  nuts) and vegetables - cold storage facilities; aquaculture (excluding systems that
  maintain live animals through uptake and discharge of water); floriculture; hops;
  milk; rye; meat and poultry (unprocessed); eggs; cheese, butter and yogurt. The
  loan must be approved by the local FSA state or county committee before any site
  preparation, construction, and/or acquisition can be started. All loan requests
  are subject to an environmental evaluation. Accepting delivery of equipment, starting
  any site preparation, or construction before loan approval, may impede the successful
  completion of an environmental evaluation and may adversely affect loan eligibility.'
