objective: NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate is the heart of the agency’s
  space exploration efforts, enabling missions to low Earth orbit, the Moon, and beyond
  through communication and navigation, launch services, research capabilities, and
  crew health and support. SOMD manages NASA crewed space operations in and beyond
  low-Earth orbit (LEO) and commercial launch services. SOMD operates, and maintains
