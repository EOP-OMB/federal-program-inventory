  \ activities, and providing advice. State/Interstate Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS)\
  \ Management Plans: This funding authorized in NANPCA supports state or interstate\
  \ organizations to implement their ANSTF-approved ANS Plans. Only states or interstate\
  \ organizations with an approved plan are eligible for this annual support. \n\n\

  \ support for projects that eradicate an invasive species or for research to increase\
  \ the effectiveness and near-term availability of eradication tools."
