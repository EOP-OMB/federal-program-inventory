objective: "The objectives of the Fish and Aquatic Conservation activities conducted\
  \ under this program are as follows:\n\nState and Interstate Aquatic Nuisance Species\
  \ Management Plans (ANS Plans): To provide funding to States to implement ANS Plans\
  \ approved by the ANS Task Force, as authorized in the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance\
  \ Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA). The plans identify activities needed to eliminate\
  \ or reduce the risks associated with ANS, focusing on feasible, cost-effective\
  \ management efforts to prevent and control ANS infestations in an environmentally\
  \ sound manner.  Only States with approved ANS Plans are eligible for this annual\
  \ funding. \n\nAquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task Force Regional Panels: To provide\
  \ funding to the ANS Task Force established by the NANPCA.  The Task Force implements\
  \ a program for waters of the United States to prevent introduction and dispersal\
  \ of ANS, monitor, control, and study such species, and disseminate related information.\
  \ Task Force activities include six regional panels that engage a broad spectrum\
  \ of stakeholders to provide balanced advice to the Task Force on issues of regional\
  \ significance. The program helps the panels fulfil their responsibilities under\
  \ the NANPCA including identifying regional priorities, coordinating regional activities,\
  \ providing advice pertinent to regional issues, and making recommendations and\
  \ reporting to the Task Force. \n\nNational Fish Passage (NFP): To restore native\
  \ fish and other aquatic species to self-sustaining levels by reconnecting habitat\
  \ that barriers have fragmented, where such reconnection would not result in a net\
  \ negative ecological effect such as providing increased habitat to aquatic nuisance\
  \ species. Fish passage projects restore unimpeded flows and fish movement by removing\
  \ barriers or providing ways for aquatic species to bypass them. The program works\
  \ on a voluntary basis and provides support to Federal, State, local, and tribal\
  \ agencies, as well as private partners and stakeholders.\n\nNational Fish Habitat\
  \ Partnership (NFHP): To comprehensively address the causes of fish habitat decline\
  \ by working together with partners to maximize the impact of limited funding for\
  \ fish habitat conservation. Under NFHP, Federal, State, Tribal, and privately-raised\
  \ funds are leveraged through regional Fish Habitat Partnerships to address the\
  \ fish habitat challenges. More information about the Fish Habitat Partnerships\
  \ and their partners can be found online at www.fishhabitat.org.\n\nGreat Lakes\
  \ Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (GLFWRA): To provide assistance to States, Indian\
  \ Tribes, and other interested entities to encourage cooperative conservation, restoration,\
  \ research, and management of the fish and wildlife resources and their habitats\
  \ in the Great Lakes Basin. \n\nSea Lamprey Control (SLC): To work with partners\
  \ to assess sea lamprey abundance in the Great Lakes by monitoring the spring spawning\
  \ migration in tributaries. Population assessments allow the Service to estimate\
  \ the index of adult sea lampreys and evaluate the success of the Sea Lamprey Control\
  \ Program.\n\nInvasive Carp: To work with partners to assess priority needs across\
  \ the Mississippi River Sub-basins (Upper Mississippi River, Missouri River, Arkansas-Red-White\
  \ River, Lower Mississippi River, Tennessee Cumberland River, and Ohio River including\
  \ in Kentucky Lake, Lake Barkley) and the Great Lakes, to determine the most effective\
  \ allocation of resources to support goals identified in the Management and Control\
  \ Plan for Bighead, Black, Grass, and Silver Carps in the United States (National\
  \ Plan)."
