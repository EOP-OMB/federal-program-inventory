- description: Awards were issued to provide funding for fuel mitigation treatments,
    targeted at reducing the risk of wildfires to lives, property and livelihoods.
    These grants provide funding for hazard fuels thinning, prescribed burning, and
    creating fuel breaks removing excess vegetation that fuel potentially catastrophic
    fires. By implementing these treatments, risk is reduced, protecting both natural
    resources and the areas where we live and work. Additionally, the use of these
    competitive grant opportunities promote collaboration between local, state, and
    federal agencies as well as non-governmental organizations, and private landowners
    - working together addressing the common goal of reducing wildfire risk on the
    landscape. The result is a healthier, more resilient landscape for all.
