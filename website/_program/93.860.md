objective: "In its 1994 monograph, Addressing Emerging Infectious Disease Threats\
  \ – A Prevention Strategy for the United States, the Centers for Disease Control\
  \ and Prevention (CDC) called for the establishment of provider-based Emerging Infections\
  \ Sentinel Networks (EISNs) to monitor and evaluate conditions that are not covered\
  \ by health department surveillance and that are likely to be seen by specific kinds\
  \ of health providers. There are currently three provider-based networks established\
  \ through CDC’s EISN cooperative agreement programs: 1) Surveillance network of\
  \ infectious disease specialists, 2) Global surveillance network of travel medicine\
  \ clinics, and 3) Emergency department-based network of academically affiliated\
  \ emergency departments for research on emerging infectious diseases.  The first\
  \ two networks (infectious disease specialists and travel medicine clinics) are\
  \ non-research programs, and the third network (academically affiliated EDs) is\
  \ a research program. These networks contribute to surveillance for emerging infectious\
  \ diseases, including drug resistant, foodborne and waterborne, and vaccine-preventable\
  \ or potentially vaccine-preventable diseases, and enhance information exchange\
  \ leading to early identification of and response to trends and outbreaks. \r\n\
  Objectives for the provider-based sentinel networks include the following:\r\n-\t\
  To support linked groups of participating individuals or organizations in monitoring\
  \ a variety of infectious disease problems and enhancing communication and collaboration\
  \ among network members and the public health community;\r\n-\tTo serve as readily\
  \ accessible mechanisms to address urgent public health infectious disease problems\
  \ rapidly; and\r\n-\tTo improve understanding of specific public health issues,\
  \ including, but not limited to, international travel, and enhance preparedness\
  \ to meet new infectious disease threats among domestic and globally mobile populations.\r\
  \nAdditional objectives for the \"research\" EISN include:\r\n-\tTo focus studies\
  \ on the most important issues to be addressed by participating hospital EDs and\
  \ CDC; and\r\n-\tTo estimate the community burden of diseases."
