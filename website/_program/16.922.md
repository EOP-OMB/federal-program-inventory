objective: 'The Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program is a nationwide law
  enforcement initiative that removes the tools of crime from criminal organizations,
  deters crime and deprives wrongdoers of their criminal proceeds, and recovers property
  that may be used to compensate victims.  Equitable sharing further enhances the
  law enforcement mission by fostering cooperation among federal, state, and local
  law enforcement agencies.  Federal law authorizes the Attorney General to share
  federally forfeited property with participating state and local law enforcement
  agencies.  The exercise of this authority is discretionary and limited by statute.  The
  Attorney General is not required to share property in any case.  '
