objective: The purpose of this program is to enhance the data quality and operational
  efficiency of CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NCPR). Population-based
  cancer surveillance systems must collect well-defined, interoperable data that aligns
  with clinical practice.  This program will ensure the development and dissemination
  of uniform standards in cancer staging, collection and reporting and will support
  central cancer registries to achieve complete and timely reporting on cancer in
  order to inform public health activities and measure progress in cancer prevention
  and control.
