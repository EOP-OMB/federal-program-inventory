objective: The purpose of the Environmental Regulatory Enhancement (ERE) program is
  to provide funding for the costs of planning, developing, and implementing programs
  designed to improve the capability of tribal governing bodies to regulate environmental
  quality pursuant to federal and tribal environmental laws. The ERE program supports
  the principle that projects must follow tribal cultural preservation and natural
  resource management priorities in order to achieve environmentally healthy, sustainable
  Native American and Alaska Native communities. The Administration for Native Americans
  (ANA) is therefore interested in supporting locally designed projects that strengthen
  tribal environmental regulatory programs in a manner consistent with the goals of
  native communities.
