objective: "Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse\
  \ of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous\
  \ substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The objectives of the Brownfield Multipurpose,\
  \ Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup cooperative agreements (project grants)\
  \ are to provide funding: (1) to inventory, characterize, assess, and conduct planning\
  \ and community involvement related to brownfield sites; (2) to capitalize a revolving\
  \ loan fund (RLF) which provide loans and subgrants to carry out cleanup activities\
  \ at brownfield sites; (3) to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites that\
  \ are owned by the grant recipient; and (4) to inventory, characterize, assess,\
  \ plan or remediate one or more brownfield sites in an area proposed for Multipurpose\
  \ cooperative agreements. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2025 - Funding Priorities:\
  \ Funding will support at least 130 Assessment cooperative agreements (estimated\
  \ $117 million) that recipients may use to inventory, assess, cleanup and plan reuse\
  \ at brownfield sites, as authorized under CERCLA Section 104(k)(2). Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds will be used for approximately 18 Assessment\
  \ cooperative agreements. IIJA funds will support at least 60 direct Cleanup cooperative\
  \ agreements (estimated $100 million) to enable eligible entities to clean up properties\
  \ that the recipient owns, as authorized under CERCLA Section 104(k)(3). IIJA funds\
  \ will support at least 15 competitive RLF cooperative agreements (estimated $15\
  \ million) to capitalize a revolving loan fund which provides loans and subgrants\
  \ to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites, as authorized under CERCLA\
  \ Section 104(k)(3). In addition, approximately 25 RLF supplemental awards (estimated\
  \ at $40 million) will be made non-competitively to current RLF cooperative agreement\
  \ recipients who meet supplemental funding criteria, in order to re-capitalize their\
  \ RLF for additional loans and subgrants. IIJA funds will be used for FY25 RLF supplemental\
  \ funding awards.\nConsistent with the direction on cost sharing in the Bipartisan\
  \ Infrastructure Law, cost sharing and matching funds are not required for Cleanup\
  \ and RLF cooperative agreements. Recipients will be required to report site-specific\
  \ accomplishments for IIJA-funded activities in the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment,\
  \ Exchange System (ACRES) and collected data will be used to demonstrate successful\
  \ implementation of the program. \nCertain projects (i.e., primarily cleanup projects)\
  \ are subject to the Buy America Sourcing requirements under the Build America,\
  \ Buy America (BABA) provisions IIJA (P.L. 117-58, §§ 70911-70917) when using funds\
  \ for the purchase of goods, products, and materials on any form of construction,\
  \ alteration, maintenance, or repair of infrastructure in the United States. The\
  \ Buy America preference requirement applies to all of the iron and steel, manufactured\
  \ products, and construction materials used for an infrastructure project under\
  \ an award identified in EPA’s financial assistance funding programs subject to\
  \ BABA report."
