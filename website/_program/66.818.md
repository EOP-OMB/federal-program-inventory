objective: 'Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse
  of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous
  substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The objectives of the Brownfield Multipurpose,
  Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup cooperative agreements (project grants)
  are to provide funding: (1) to inventory, characterize, assess, and conduct planning
  and community involvement related to brownfield sites; (2) to capitalize a revolving
  loan fund (RLF) which provide loans and subgrants to carry out cleanup activities
  at brownfield sites; (3) to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites that
  are owned by the grant recipient; and (4) to inventory, characterize, assess, plan
  or remediate one or more brownfield sites in an area proposed for Multipurpose cooperative
  agreements. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023 - Funding Priorities: Funding
  will support at least 95 Assessment cooperative agreements (estimated $85.5 million)
  that recipients may use to inventory, assess, cleanup and plan reuse at brownfield
  sites, as authorized under CERCLA 104(k)(2). Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
  Act (IIJA) funds will be used for approximately 15 Assessment cooperative agreements.
  IIJA funds will support at least 70 direct Cleanup cooperative agreements (estimated
  $59 million) to enable eligible entities to clean up properties that the recipient
  owns, as authorized under CERCLA 104(k)(3). IIJA funds will support at least 10
  competitive RLF cooperative agreements (estimated $10 million) to capitalize a revolving
  loan fund which provides loans and subgrants to carry out cleanup activities at
  brownfield sites, as authorized under CERCLA 104(k)(3). In addition, approximately
  23 RLF supplemental awards (estimated at $60 million) will be made non-competitively
  to current RLF grant recipients who meet supplemental funding criteria, in order
  to re-capitalize their RLF for additional loans and subgrants. IIJA funds will be
  used for FY23 RLF supplemental funding awards. Fiscal Year 2024 - Funding Priorities:
  Funding will support at least 90 Assessment cooperative agreements (estimated $100
  million) that recipients may use to inventory, assess, cleanup and plan reuse at
  brownfield sites, as authorized under CERCLA 104(k)(2). Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds will be used for approximately 15 Assessment cooperative
  agreements. IIJA funds will support at least 60 direct Cleanup cooperative agreements
  (estimated $95 million) to enable eligible entities to clean up properties that
  the recipient owns, as authorized under CERCLA 104(k)(3). IIJA funds will support
  approximately 20 RLF supplemental awards (estimated at $50 million) will be made
  non-competitively to current RLF grant recipients who meet supplemental funding
  criteria, in order to re-capitalize their RLF for additional loans and subgrants.'
