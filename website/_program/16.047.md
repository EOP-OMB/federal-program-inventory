objective: 'Goal(s): The listing is designed to leverage the skills and abilities
  of community-based organizations (CBOs) and civil rights organizations to address
  hate crimes. The funding serves entire communities, but specifically can benefit
  both individuals and groups who may be targets of hate crimes, law enforcement and
  prosecution entities that wish to better prevent and respond to hate crimes, and
  service providers who work with individuals or groups who may experience hate crimes.
  This funding is unique because comprehensive approaches to hate crimes require incorporating
  lived experience into policies, developing community resiliency, and focusing on
  prevention. CBOs and civil rights organizations are uniquely suited to carry out
  this work. Existing funding streams aimed at addressing hate crimes largely focus
  on improving responses from law enforcement or prosecution agencies.


  Objective: The Community-Based Approaches to Advancing Justice program provides
  funding to support comprehensive community-based approaches to addressing hate crimes
  that promote community awareness and preparedness, increase in victim reporting,
  and improve responses to hate crimes.
