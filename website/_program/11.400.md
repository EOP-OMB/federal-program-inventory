layout: program
objective: "Two programs exist in this CFDA:\nA.The National Geodetic Survey (NGS)\
  \ is a program office within the National Ocean Service (NOS) that provides the\
  \ authoritative coordinate system for all positioning activities in the Nation.\
  \ Known as the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), NGS\u2019 authoritative\
  \ coordinate system defines latitude, longitude, height, gravity, and shoreline\
  \ information, which supports a wide range of important activities, including mapping\
  \ and charting, navigation, transportation, infrastructure, flood risk determination,\
  \ national security, and environmental observations. NGS also develops industry\
  \ guidelines, specifications, and standards and provides training for surveyors,\
  \ mapping professionals, scientists and other users of the NSRS. \nB. Joint Ocean\
  \ and Coastal Mapping Centers are authorized in the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration\
  \ Act  to advance the purposes of the Acts including research and development of\
  \ hydrographic technologies necessary to ensure safe and efficient navigation; research\
  \ and development of innovative ocean and coastal mapping technologies, equipment,\
  \ and data products; mapping of the United States Outer Continental Shelf and other\
  \ regions; data processing for nontraditional data and uses; advancing the use of\
  \ remote sensing technologies, for related issues, including mapping and assessment\
  \ of essential fish habitat and of coral resources, ocean observations, and ocean\
  \ exploration; and providing graduate education and training in ocean and coastal\
  \ mapping sciences.\nThe goals of this financial assistance listing are\n1. To conduct\
  \ research in the field of geodesy and improve applications of geodesy and the National\
  \ Spatial Reference System\n2. To improve the techniques and technology of geodetic\
  \ and hydrographic surveys and related data, products, and services\n3. Extend the\
  \ National Spatial Reference System into areas not adequately covered to meet infrastructure\
  \ needs.\n4. To educate and provide outreach to the public on applications of geodesy,\
  \ hydrography and related data products, and services"
