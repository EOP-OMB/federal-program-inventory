    The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) was enacted into law
    on December 27, 2020 and included Division X, the “Supporting Foster Youth and
    Families through the Pandemic Act.”  Division X contained additional, supplemental
    or enhanced funding for several programs authorized under titles IV-B and IV-E
    of the Act.  For the Education and Training Voucher Program it provided an additional
    $50 million to states and eligible tribes.  The law also provided certain flexibilities
    in program requirements that remained in effect through September 30, 2021.  It
    also increased the maximum amount of voucher award to $12,000 for fiscal years
    2021 and 2022. Please see Program Instruction ACYF-CB-PI-21-04 for more information.  Therefore,
    FY 2021 grant award information will differ from other years.'
