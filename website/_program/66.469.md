objective: 'The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was launched in 2010 as
  a nonregulatory program to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the largest
  system of fresh surface water in the world by providing additional resources to
  help achieve the most critical long-term goals for this important ecosystem. USEPA
  leads an interagency group of 16 federal agencies to implement the GLRI. Since 2010,
  the GLRI has funded more than 8,000 projects that have been implemented by federal
  agencies, states, tribes, local governments, universities, and nongovernmental organizations.
  USEPA and the other federal agencies will continue to use GLRI resources to strategically
  target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and associated human health
  issues in partnership with states, Tribes and other nonfederal stakeholders. Funded
  projects will address the most significant Great Lakes ecosystem problems and efforts
  in the five major focus areas identified in the GLRI Action Plan: Toxic Substances
  and Areas of Concern; Invasive Species; Nonpoint Source Pollution; Habitats and
  Species; and Foundations for Future Restoration Actions. Funded activities will
  also advance protection and restoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem in support
  of (i) the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative as described in the Great Lakes Restoration
  Initiative Action Plan III, Fiscal Year 2020-Fiscal Year 2024, and Action Plan IV
  when it is released, located at https://glri.us; (ii) Objective 5.2 (Protect and
  Restore Waterbodies and Watersheds) of EPA''s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan (available
  from: https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/strategicplan); and/or (iii) the Great Lakes
  Water Quality Agreement. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2025: USEPA will continue
  to use GLRI resources to strategically target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes
  ecosystem and associated human health issues identified in the GLRI Action Plan
  IV. The GLRI will continue to prioritize the clean-up of Areas of Concern, reducing
  phosphorus contributions from agricultural and urban lands that contribute to harmful
  algal blooms and other water quality impairments, and invasive species prevention.
  These priorities and new initiatives will also be supported by the Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding.'
