objective: 'To restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity
  of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. USEPA leads a consortium of programs, agencies,
  and public and private institutions in attaining specific objectives and actions
  that will address the most significant Great Lakes ecosystem problems and efforts
  in five major focus areas: Toxic Substances and Areas of Concern; Invasive Species;
  Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health; Habitats and Species; and
  Foundations for Future Restoration Actions. Funded activities will advance protection
  and restoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem in support of (i) the Great Lakes Restoration
  Initiative as described in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan III
  (available from: https://www.epa.gov/great-lakes-funding/great-lakes-restoration-initiative-action-plan-iii);
  (ii) Objective 5.2 (Protect and Restore Waterbodies and Watersheds) of EPA''s 2022-2026
  Strategic Plan (available from: https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/strategicplan);
  and/or (iii) the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy to Protect and Restore
  the Great Lakes (available from: https://www.gsgp.org/projects/protection-and-restoration/great-lakes-regional-collaboration/glrc-strategy/
  ).  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Projects will be funded in five GLRI
  Action Plan focus areas: (i) Toxic Substances and Areas of Concern; (ii) Invasive
  Species; (iii) Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health; (iv) Habitats
  and Species; and (v) Foundations for Future Restoration Actions. The GLRI places
  a special priority on cleaning up and de-listing Areas of Concern, reducing phosphorus
  contributions from agricultural and urban lands that contribute to harmful algal
  blooms and other water quality impairments, and invasive species prevention.  These
  priorities and new initiatives will also be supported by the Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding.'
