  evaluations, workshops, conferences, and demonstration projects that lead to reduced
  pollutants generated and conservation of natural resources; (2) improve economic
  information and analytic methods to support studies, surveys, analyses, evaluations,
  conferences, workshops, and demonstration projects on the benefits, costs, and impacts
  of environmental programs; (3) improve economic information and analytic methods
  to support studies, surveys, analyses, evaluations, conferences, workshops, and
  demonstration projects of incentive-based and voluntary environmental management
  strategies and mechanisms; (4) support research to explore and develop strategies
  and mechanisms for those in the economic, social, governmental, and environmental
  arenas to use in environmental management decisions; (5) provide technical assistance
  to help communities to learn about and implement locally led, community driven approaches
  that deliver environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and (6) build
  and strengthen the adaptive capacity of states, tribes, and local communities to
  anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather (e.g., storms
  and droughts) and other events (e.g., wildfires, sea level rise and storm surges)
  now and in the future.
