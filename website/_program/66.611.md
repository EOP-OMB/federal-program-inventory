  pollutants generated and conservation of natural resources; (2) improve economic
  information and analytic methods to support studies, surveys, analyses, evaluations,
  conferences, workshops, and demonstration projects on the benefits, costs, and impacts
  of environmental programs; (3) improve economic information and analytic methods
  to support studies, surveys, analyses, evaluations, conferences, workshops, and
  demonstration projects of incentive-based and voluntary environmental management
  strategies and mechanisms; (4) support research to explore and develop strategies
  and mechanisms for those in the economic, social, governmental, and environmental
  arenas to use in environmental management decisions; (5) provide technical assistance
  to help communities to learn about and implement locally led, community driven approaches
  that deliver environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and (6) build
  and strengthen the adaptive capacity of states, tribes, and local communities to
  anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather (e.g., storms
  and droughts) and other events (e.g., wildfires, sea level rise and storm surges)
  now and in the future.

- description: "Most of the environmental economics research grants awarded under\
    \ this CFDA have ended, and the few that remain are wrapping up in FY2016\r\n\r\
    \n\r\nOne environmental economics research project funded under this CFDA that\
    \ concluded this year sought to develop a series of complementary analyses for\
    \ understanding the economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness, and distributional\
    \ effects of overlapping policies, accounting for how different policy instruments\
    \ interact with one another, and how they perform in the presence of induced technological\
    \ change. The methods were applied to the two sectors of greatest import for GHG\
    \ and conventional pollutant emissions: electricity generation and transportation.\
    \ The first objective was to conduct a comprehensive review of existing policies\
    \ and major proposals for reducing emissions and promoting clean technologies\
    \ in these sectors. The second goal was to develop an analytical model of consumer,\
    \ supplier, and overall market responses to these kinds of policy interventions,\
    \ in order to develop intuition about interactions among policies. Importantly,\
    \ in addition to an emissions externality, the model would incorporate two types\
    \ of market imperfections that often motivate technology- specific policies: undervaluation\
    \ of energy efficiency by consumers and spillovers from knowledge accumulated\
    \ by producers. The third goal was to develop numerical models following the conceptual\
    \ analysis, and carefully parameterize them for our two sectoral applications.\
    \ The ultimate goal was to provide a comprehensive guide for policymakers on how\
    \ the existing abundance of policies and policy options should be understood,\
    \ coordinated, and possibly reformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir work was successful, producing\
    \ the following types of information and materials:\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of\
    \ a simple unifying model to analyze interactions among overlapping environmental\
    \ policies, particularly those that involve tradable credit mechanisms. The model\
    \ was extended to allow for both more and less mature renewable energy sources\
    \ (e.g., wind versus solar), differentiating the innovation market failures among\
    \ these different classes, and by incorporating demand-side market failures e.g.,\
    \ the undervaluation of energy efficiency improvements). It demonstrates that\
    \ the value of a given policy change depends on the extent to which any and all\
    \ of these market failures are internalized.\r\n\r\nThe model was further adapted\
    \ to allow for the peculiarities of the transportation fuels sector. This included\
    \ modeling the nested targets in the Renewable Fuels Standard, a low-carbon fuel\
    \ standard, and different forms of CAFE standards, including size-based incentives.\
    \ It highlights how each of these policies can be modeled as combinations of implicit\
    \ taxes and subsidies and reveals how they interact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research\
    \ led to parameterization of a new analytical model for the electricity sector.\
    \ This permitted quantitative analysis about the optimal policy combinations.\
    \ A significant focus was on the optimal deployment subsidies for wind and solar\
    \ and their sensitivity to a variety of assumptions regarding the potential for\
    \ learning-by-doing, the degree of spillovers, and the stringency of the emissions\
    \ target. Central estimates for these values were in the range of 1 cent for wind\
    \ (mature renewable technologies) and 5 cents/kWh for solar. While they rise somewhat\
    \ as emissions reduction targets get more stringent, the carbon price in the optimal\
    \ carbon policy combination is what rises most significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development\
    \ and parameterization of this model proved more challenging than expected. The\
    \ baseline involves a large pre-existing suite of policy incentives and mandates,\
    \ for which implicit values must be calculated. Incorporating realistic fuel economy\
    \ strategies required calibrating both technological and size-based opportunities\
    \ for fuel economy improvements. Trying to maintain an overall calibration strategy\
    \ of relying on EIA data (projections generated from the much more complex NEMS\
    \ model), while being consistent with other empirical evidence on innovation and\
    \ renewable fuels, required significant innovations in terms of the model and\
    \ solution strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results emphasize the inefficiency of current\
    \ federal renewable fuel standards and size-based fuel economy standards relative\
    \ to direct taxes on carbon or gasoline. We find that the current mix of state\
    \ and federal fuel taxes, fuel economy standards, and renewable fuel blending\
    \ mandates leads to a 13% reduction in domestic carbon emissions from this sector\
    \ relative to a no-policy baseline at an average private welfare cost of $18/tCO2.\
    \ These policies induce behavioral changes that are highly cost-ineffective, however,\
    \ as evidenced by a marginal cost of carbon abatement that varies widely across\
    \ competing abatement options: $0/tCO2 to $736/tCO2 for options based on fuel\
    \ switching (e.g., from gasoline to ethanol) and negative $45/tCO2 to positive\
    \ $73/tCO2 for options based on conservation (i.e., driving fewer miles or improving\
    \ fuel economy). Negative abatement costs for conservation arise in this setting\
    \ due to consumer undervaluation of fuel economy and due to existing policies\
    \ that implicitly subsidize ethanol well beyond the point where its marginal cost\
    \ exceeds its energy value. In contrast, the optimal carbon policy — a carbon\
    \ tax combined with corrective subsidies for cellulosic ethanol production and\
    \ fuel economy improvements—can achieve the same 13% reduction in carbon emissions,\
    \ but at an average private welfare gain of $15/tCO2 relative to no policy.\r\n\

    \ activities of current grant recipients:\r\n\r\n\r\n$135,000 for Smart Growth\

    \ with corrective subsidies for cellulosic ethanol production and fuel economy\
    \ improvements—can achieve the same 13% reduction in carbon emissions, but at\
    \ an average private welfare gain of $15/tCO2 relative to no policy. Due to limited\
    \ funds, during Fiscal Year 2016, EPA’s Office of Sustainable Communities did\
    \ not fund any new cooperative agreements. For awards related to Sustainable Communities,\
    \ program accomplishments involved supporting activities of current grant recipients:\
    \ a Smart Growth Conference held in February 2016 and attended by 1,700 people\
    \ from the public and private sector, a Smart Growth On-line Website and Policy\
    \ Clearinghouse, technical assistance workshops in 14 communities addressing land\
    \ use and code audits to promote more sustainable development, technical assistance\
    \ workshops in 9 communities addressing complete streets and sustainable design\
    \ workshops focused on opportunities to enhance community sustainability through\
    \ state policy, and technical assistance workshops in 8 communities using the\
    \ LEED for Neighborhood Development Standards as a tool for evaluating options\
    \ to improve community environmental performance. "

- description: 'The program supported two conferences that provided forums for presenting
    advances in research in environmental, natural resource and energy economic and
    policy issues.  These conferences brought together top researchers in the field
    of economics, as well as representatives of governmental regulatory and policy
    institutions. The conferences provided incentives for leading researchers to focus
    on policy-relevant research topics within environmental and energy economics and
    to communicate their findings in impactful ways.  The conferences provided opportunities
    for academic researchers to communicate directly with members of the professional
    staff and researchers at government agencies and NGOs focused on environmental,
    natural resource and energy policy.  The conferences also served to foster relationships
    with federal agency partners and encourage sharing research, promoting collaborations,
    and setting research agendas on priority issues, such as the areas of climate
    change and environmental justice.   For additional information about this program
    and achievements associated with this assistance listing, please visit the following
