objective: "The goal of this program is to assist states and localities in developing\
  \ or expanding services that meet the needs of incarcerated parents and their children.\
  \ Programs proposed should aim to prevent violent crime, reduce recidivism, and\
  \ protect the safety of law enforcement (correctional officers) within state and\
  \ locally managed facilities or private facilities under contract with a state or\
  \ locality. In addition to engaging incarcerated parents and their children, this\
  \ program supports the delivery of transitional reentry services, including services\
  \ to minor children, upon release to reduce recidivism and prevent violent crime.\
  \  \n\nObjective for this program include: (1) develop a coordinated system for\
  \ the provision of programs and services that support the needs of children of incarcerated\
  \ parents, such as mental health issues, substance use issues, and trauma-related\
  \ issues, to ensure minor children remain connected with their parents in a structured\
  \ and supportive environment; (2) develop and implement programs and resources that\
  \ equip parents with tools to identify and address problematic behaviors in their\
  \ children, thus improving the parent\u2019s ability to be involved; (3) develop\
  \ strategies and approaches to strengthen the relationships between incarcerated\
  \ parents and their children; (4) seek to reduce the incarcerated parent\u2019s\
  \ behavioral infractions during incarceration and recidivism post-release; (5) provide\
  \ services that foster positive youth development for children of incarcerated parents;\
  \ these services may include, but are not limited to, mentoring for these children;\
  \ and (6) develop innovative approaches that will enhance child/parent communication,\
  \ such as the use of tele-visiting, emailing, letter writing, audio recordings,\
  \ and transportation assistance for in-person visits.\n\nThe performance measures\
  \ associated with these objectives are: \nPM 1: Percentage of eligible individuals\
  \ served by a mental health treatment service\n\nPM 2: Percentage of eligible individuals\
  \ served by a substance use disorder treatment service\n\nPM 3: Percentage of eligible\
  \ individual\u2019s case plans informed by parents/legal guardians\n\nPM 4: Percentage\
  \ of parental visits where the child/children appropriately participated"
