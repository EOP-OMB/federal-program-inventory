objective: The overall purpose of the Eviction Protection Grant Program is to support
  experienced legal service providers, not limited to legal service corporations,
  in providing legal assistance at no cost to low-income tenants at risk of or subject
  to eviction. This grant program plays an integral role in helping individuals and
  families, including people of color who are disproportionately represented among
  those evicted, people with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities,
  avoid eviction or minimize the disruption and damage caused by the eviction process.
