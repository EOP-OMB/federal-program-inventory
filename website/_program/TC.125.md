objective: The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures
  including charitable contributions. In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers
  a deduction for contributions to charitable, religious, and certain other nonprofit
  organizations. Taxpayers who donate capital assets to charitable organizations can
  deduct the assets’ current value without being taxed on any appreciation in value.
  An individual’s total charitable contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent
  (60 percent between 2018 and 2025) of adjusted gross income; a corporation’s total
  charitable contributions generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income.
