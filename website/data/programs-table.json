an integrated, interconnected transportation system important to interstate commerce and travel), and for other special purpose programs and projects.  This program also provides for the construction and improvement of highways in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\n2) The Federal Lands Highway Program: The Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) provides assistance to the Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) for Federally-owned roads and trails. It provides transportation engineering services and funding for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges that are on or provide access to federally owned lands. The Federal Lands Highway organization also provides training, technology deployment, and engineering services to other customers. \n\n3) The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (IIJA) Act also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure that will help grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness, create good jobs, and build our safe, resilient, and equitable transportation future.  BIL provides the basis for FHWA programs and activities through September 30, 2026.  It makes an investment of $350 billion in highway programs. This includes the largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  New programs under the BIL focus on key infrastructure priorities including rehabilitating bridges in critical need of repair, reducing carbon emissions, increasing system resilience, removing barriers to connecting communities, and improving mobility and access to economic opportunity.  Many of the new programs include eligibility for local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Tribes, and other public authorities, allowing them to compete directly for funding.  BIL also continues to focus the program on safety and performance-based investment and on accelerating project delivery through expedited environmental review and elimination of duplicate processes.\n\n4) The Highway Infrastructure Programs in the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2018, included two new discretionary programs:  Competitive Bridge Program and Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program.  The Competitive Bridge Program was appropriated $225 million to be used for highway bridge rehabilitation or replacement projects for States that have a population density of less than 100 individuals per square mile and that demonstrate cost savings by bundling multiple highway bridge projects.","popularName":"Federal-Aid Highway Program,  Federal Lands Highway Program","agency":{"title":"Department of Transportation","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Highway Administration"}},"assistanceTypes":["Salaries and Expenses"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Transportation","subCategory":{"title":"Highways, Public Roads, and Bridges"}}]},{"cfda":"17.225","title":"Unemployment Insurance","permalink":"/program/17.225","obligations":41127000000.0,"objectives":"To implement and oversee unemployment insurance programs for eligible workers through federal and state cooperation;

Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program serves the most economically vulnerable families in the country, including families with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless veterans, and families with children, through federal assistance voucher payments in the provision of meeting their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of the legislation is \"consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the \"USHA\") into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families\". The HCVP is administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate housing programs within an area or jurisdiction. The PHAs receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer the voucher program. The PHA accepts a family\u2019s application for rental assistance, selects the applicant family for admission, and issues the selected family a voucher confirming the family\u2019s eligibility for assistance. The family must then find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the family\u2019s needs and desires in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant Payment contracts with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Housing and Urban Development","subAgency":{"title":"Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments for a Specified Use"],"applicantTypes":["Other private institutions/organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Housing","subCategory":{"title":"Homebuying, Homeownership"}}]},{"cfda":"84.063","title":"Federal Pell Grant Program","permalink":"/program/84.063","obligations":26618505000.0,"objectives":"To provide eligible undergraduate postsecondary students who have demonstrated financial need with grant assistance to help meet educational expenses.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Education","subAgency":{"title":"Office of Federal Student Aid"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments for a Specified Use"],"applicantTypes":["Individual/Family","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)"],"categories":[{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Vocational Development"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Higher Education - General"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Nursing Education"}}]},{"cfda":"93.461","title":"HRSA COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement for the Uninsured Program and the COVID-19 Coverage Assistance Fund","permalink":"/program/93.461","obligations":24657470000.0,"objectives":"The COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities for Testing, Treatment, and Vaccine Administration for the Uninsured Program \u2013 also known as the Uninsured Program \u2013 provides claims reimbursement to eligible health care providers for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured, treating uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and administering FDA-authorized or licensed COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured individuals.\n\nThe COVID-19 Coverage Assistance Fund (CAF) provides COVID-19 vaccine administration fee claims reimbursement to eligible health care providers who provide COVID-19 vaccines to patients enrolled in health coverage that either does not cover vaccine administration fees, or does cover the administration fees but has patient cost-sharing.\n\nWith the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and related rescission of program funds, no additional claims payments will be made under the Uninsured Program or Coverage Assistance Fund.

The program is designed to involve parents in their child\u2019s learning and development, and to help parents make progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of their local Head Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards outline the requirements and expectations of programs in delivering these services.  Head Start programs are expected to collaborate with other early care and education programs in their communities, and to work closely with local school systems to continue the gains children achieve in Head Start.\n\nThrough Early Head Start programming, the focus includes the development of children, and the enabling of parents to fulfill their roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These programs promote the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals, programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives of the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\nSince 2014 through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start programs or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  \n\nThe Office of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge, skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn, improve the outcomes of children and families. The system includes four National Centers, each with an area of focus that collaborate effectively to support and promote consistent practices across Head Start/Early Head Start communities.  The centers include Program Management and Fiscal Operations; Early Childhood Development, Teaching and Learning; Parent, Family, and Community Engagement; and Health, Behavioral Health, and Safety.  \n\nAwards are also issued to Tribal Colleges & Universities for establishing or enhancing partnerships with Head Start programs to effectively increase the number of qualified education staff working in American Indian Alaska Native Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In collaboration with the Office of Child Care and Office of Early Childhood Development, Head Start provides funding to the National Early Care and Education Workforce Center to support recruitment and retainment strategies across all Early Care and Education settings.

As an important component of that mission, ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity, efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection, and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including Executive Order 13985 \u2013 \u201cExecutive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government\u201d, Executive Order 14005 \u2013 \u201cEnsuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America\u2019s Workers\u201d, and Executive Order 14008 \u2013 \u201cTackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad\u201d (as listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the FAA\u2019s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.","popularName":"AIP, CARES, ARPA, and BIL","agency":{"title":"Department of Transportation","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Aviation Administration"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other public institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":[{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Construction, Renewal and Operations"}},{"title":"Transportation","subCategory":{"title":"Air Transportation"}}]},{"cfda":"10.557","title":"WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ","permalink":"/program/10.557","obligations":7249589108.0,"objectives":"To provide low-income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age five who are determined to be at nutritional risk with supplemental nutritious foods, nutrition education, and referrals to health and social services at no cost.

As a block grant, CCDF gives funding to States, Territories, and Tribes to provide child care subsidies primarily through vouchers or certificates to low-income families. In addition, CCDF funds are used to improve the quality of child care for both subsidized and unsubsidized children. CCDF consists of both Discretionary funding authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and Mandatory and Matching funding under the Social Security Act. \nThe CCDBG was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) and is subject to annual appropriations. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) consolidated funding for child care under the Social Security Act, where CCDF mandatory and matching funding is authorized, and made such funding generally subject to the requirements of the CCDBG Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-186) reauthorized the discretionary portion of CCDF through FY 2020 and made significant changes to improve the health, safety, and quality of child care and provide more continuous child care assistance to low-income children and families. In addition to the block grants to States, Territories and Tribes, a small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to lead agencies on administering the program.  A small portion of CCDF is also used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities.  The Discretionary portion of the CCDF funds provides about $7.9 billion in federal funding per year for child care.

The Mandatory and Matching funds are made available in section 418 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are not subject to annual appropriations. Allocations of the Mandatory Funds are based on a State's Federal share of the expenditures for the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the average of 1992 through 1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to expend any State funds in order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. Previously, the Mandatory and Matching funds provided about $2.9 billion in federal funding per year for child care.  The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) was enacted March 11, 2021 and appropriated $3,550,000,000 (Section 9801) in mandatory and matching funding for CCDF, which is a permanent annual appropriation effective fiscal year 2021. The appropriation includes $3.375 billion to States, $75 million to Territories (previously not eligible), and $100 million to Tribes. \n To access Matching Funds, a State must obligate all of its Mandatory Funds allotted in a fiscal year and maintain 100% of the State's share of expenditures for the former programs in fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, whichever is greater (i.e., maintenance of effort). Matching Funds must be matched at the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, which is the Medicaid Program matching rate. The Matching Funds are distributed based on the number of children under age 13 in a State compared with the national total of children under age 13.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) appropriated $3.375 billion in CCDF Mandatory and Matching funds to States. Because the state Mandatory fund amount remains fixed in law, the $512,250,000 increase appropriated to states by the ARP Act are awarded in Matching funds. Matching funds are available to states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year in which the funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state\u2019s Maintenance-of-Effort funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of Matching funds at the FMAP rate. However, states are not required to match the additional funds awarded in section 9801 of the ARP Act in FY 2021 or FY 2022.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act appropriated CCDF Mandatory funds to territories for the first time, including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Mandatory funds to territories are allotted based on the number of children under age five living in territories and per capita income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds are not subject to any matching requirements. Territory Mandatory funds must be obligated in the fiscal year that they are awarded and liquidated in the following year.\n\nNot less than 1%, but not more than 2% of the total Mandatory and Matching Funds are reserved for Tribes and tribal organizations based on the number of children living on or near Tribal reservations or other appropriate area served by the tribal recipient. Tribes and tribal organizations are not required to provide matching funds.  Prior to the ARP Act, Tribal lead agencies received a proportion of the child care funds appropriated under Section 418 of the Social Security Act.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) amended the Social Security Act to explicitly appropriate $100 million in Mandatory funds to Tribal lead agencies. This increases the initial FY 2021 Mandatory funds awarded to Tribal lead agencies by 70 percent. Otherwise, the requirements for Tribal Mandatory funds remain the same.

The new Strategic Plan builds on the successes of previous NIMH strategic plans by providing a framework for scientific research and exploration, and addressing new challenges in mental health.\n\nThe new Strategic Plan outlines four high-level Goals: \n\u2022 Goal 1: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex Behaviors\n\u2022 Goal 2: Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan\n\u2022 Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures\n\u2022 Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health Impact of NIMH-Supported Research\n\nThese four Goals form a broad roadmap for the Institute\u2019s research priorities over the next five years, beginning with the fundamental science of the brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based services that improve public health outcomes. The Institute\u2019s overall funding strategy is to support a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public health impact is a short-term measure of success.  \n\nThe new Strategic Plan also addresses a number of cross-cutting themes that are relevant to all research supported by NIMH; these themes highlight areas where NIMH-funded science may have the greatest impact, bridge gaps, and offer novel approaches to accelerate advances in mental health research. For example, NIMH values a comprehensive research agenda that takes an inclusive approach that ensures research interests are varied, maintain diverse participation and partnerships, and achieve research goals across multiple timeframes. This includes diverse methodologies, tools, and models; research addressing complex basic, translational, and applied questions; research including both sexes and, as appropriate, genetic background; and, participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, and across gender identities, geographical context, socioeconomic status, neurotype, and age \u2013 offering the best possible representation, for the broadest number of individuals who may ultimately benefit from these scientific advances.\n\nTo accomplish the Goals outlined in the new Strategic Plan, NIMH will support research that aims:\n\nTo characterize the genomic, molecular, cellular, and circuit components contributing to brain organization and function; to identify the developmental, functional, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to cognitive, affective, and social domains, across units of analysis; and, to generate and validate novel tools, techniques, and measures to quantify changes in the activity of molecules, cells, circuits, and connectomes. \n\nTo discover gene variants and other genomic elements that contribute to the development of mental illnesses in diverse populations; to advance our understanding of the complex etiology of mental illnesses using molecular epidemiologic approaches that incorporate individual genetic information in large cohorts; to elucidate how human genetic variation affects the coordination of molecular, cellular, and physiological networks supporting higher-order functions and emergent properties of neurobiological systems; and, to develop novel tools and techniques for the analysis of large-scale genetic, multi-omic data as it applies to mental health. \n\nTo utilize connectomic approaches to identify brain networks and circuit components that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction;

It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion in federal share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance indicators provide strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about FMA\u2019s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based on measurable data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n\u2022\tTotal number of NFIP-insured properties selected that are FMA and/or NFIP defined Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), and Substantially Damaged.\n\u2022\tTotal federal cost share funding invested in Justice40 Communities identified using version 1.0 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).\n\u2022\tTotal dollar amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA subapplications.\nFEMA will further assess the recipient\u2019s performance against the program objective during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding opportunity. \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood mitigation projects. The FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation\u2019s resilience to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds in line with the Administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative, the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from congressionally appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property: located within a census tract with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index score of not less than 0.5001.

Until the passage of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) (Melville Act), the program operated as a separate program distinct from the regular tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville Act converted the Mainstream 5-Year Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program under 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except for serving a specific population, Mainstream vouchers are to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance. In other words, the same regulations at 24 CFR Part 982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program) apply to Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority to treat families that receive a Mainstream voucher differently from other applicants and participants of the HCV program. After enactment of the Melville Act (i.e., subsequent to conversion of this assistance to section 8(o) voucher assistance), funding for Mainstream voucher renewals and administrative fees was first provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) under its own paragraph under the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for the first time since the enactment of the Melville Act (in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding). These incremental vouchers exclusively assisted non-elderly persons with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (\"2019 Act\") also provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities, in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act states that all new and existing Mainstream vouchers must be provided to non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover. Consistent with prior appropriations acts, all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream vouchers was provided under its own paragraph (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA heading in the 2019 Act).

Section 204 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) added $1.253 billion, extended and made changes to the program. Any funds remaining at the end of each fiscal year carry over to the next fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards to current grantees through FY 2023. Any unused grant funds awarded in FY 2023 can be used through FY 2027. No additional funding will be available after the final 2023 awards are made; however, grantees will submit documentation to identify projected costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2025 with services being provided and eligible for MFP-enhanced match through December 31, 2026. All claiming of services must be finalized by September 30, 2027. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 60 consecutive days. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible. Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with a \"qualified HCBS program\" which is a program that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals.

The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests. There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users\u2019 needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3. Develop community networks that provide real-time disaster education information;","popularName":"(CES)","agency":{"title":"Department of Agriculture","subAgency":{"title":"National Institute of Food and Agriculture"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Anyone/general public","Federal","Minority group","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Technical Assistance, Information and Services"}},{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Marketing"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Recreation"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Rural Community Development"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Technical Assistance and Services"}},{"title":"Consumer Protection","subCategory":{"title":"Information and Educational Services"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Higher Education - General"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Health Education and Training"}},{"title":"Energy","subCategory":{"title":"Conservation"}},{"title":"Environmental Quality","subCategory":{"title":"Research, Education, Training"}},{"title":"Food and Nutrition","subCategory":{"title":"Research"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Maternity, Infants, Children"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Libraries, Information and Education Services"}},{"title":"Income Security and Social Services","subCategory":{"title":"Youth Services"}},{"title":"Information and Statistics","subCategory":{"title":"General"}},{"title":"Information and Statistics","subCategory":{"title":"Libraries, Clearinghouses, Archives"}}]},{"cfda":"93.977","title":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Prevention and Control Grants","permalink":"/program/93.977","obligations":303328371.0,"objectives":"The purpose of the assistance is to strengthen STD prevention programs in eligible jurisdictions.

Ten regions are funded to ensure that the U.S. and its jurisdictions all have access to public health workforce education and training. The work of the Regional PHTCs will be accomplished through the provision of tailored training and technical assistance (TA) through collaborative community-based projects. Training curricula will provide skill-based, interactive instruction and quality education using multiple modalities (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, distance-based, bi-directional video, and in-person), underscoring the current eight cross-cutting core public health competency domains in the primary areas of (1) analytical/assessment, (2) policy development/ program planning, (3) communication skills, (4) cultural competency, (5) community dimension of practice, (6) public health sciences, (7) financial planning and management and, (8) leadership and systems thinking.  Each Regional PHTC will develop training in at least three primary areas listed above and may develop trainings in the sub competencies and beyond based on local health needs assessments. Regional PHTCs seek to develop current and future public health leaders though Leadership Institutes. Moreover, the program aims to establish and enhance collaborative partnerships among state and local health departments, primary care providers, and related organizations (to include non-traditional partners) as they work together to address critical local public health needs.\n\nThe Community Health Woker Training Program (CHWTP) expands the public health workforce through the training of new Community Health Workers (CHWs) and health support workers and to extend the knowledge and skills of current CHWs and other health support workers. Through this program, HRSA plans to train 13,000 new and current CHWs and other health support workers to support essential public health services and to focus on experiential training and employment through registered apprenticeships and job placements. The CHWTP aims to increase access to care, improve public health emergency response, and address the public health needs of underserved communities. Individuals trained through the program will acquire knowledge, skills, and expertise to respond to public health needs and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in underserved communities through a network of partnerships.\n\nThe Public Health Scholarship Program (PHSP) to strengthens the public health workforce by providing support to organizations to develop scholarship programs that incentivize individuals to pursue training and careers in public health.

Science supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this holistic perspective to improve individual and population health and advance health equity. NINR-supported research promotes health and well-being by addressing needs at multiple levels \u2013 individual, family, community, and societal levels \u2013 and developing treatment and prevention strategies that are responsive to the reality of people\u2019s lives. Nurses know people, and people trust nurses. Patient and families interact with nurses more than any other clinicians.  Nursing science uses this special relationship to better understand patients, families, and communities and the many factors that influence their health. Nursing science supported by NINR uses this knowledge to develop strategies for improving health and wellness across populations, health care settings, and the lifespan, with an emphasis on achieving health equity. NINR-supported scientists have developed interventions for:  supporting parents of premature infants; promoting HIV prevention in underserved populations; improving transitional care leading to better outcomes and cost-savings; and helping inner-city children manage asthma. Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR-supported science uses nursing science\u2019s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical and community settings to advance our understanding of the social determinants of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities that we see, such as food insecurity and access to healthcare. NINR research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR also supports science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. In addition, NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality health care.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"National Institutes of Health"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants","Training"],"applicantTypes":["Federal","Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Government - General","Individual/Family","Interstate","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Minority group","Native American Organizations (includes lndian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Nursing Education"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"General Research and Evaluation"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Health Research - General"}}]},{"cfda":"93.140","title":"Intramural Research Training Award","permalink":"/program/93.140","obligations":141301756.0,"objectives":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) IRTA Traineeships/Fellowships are established for the principal benefit of the participants and to provide opportunities for developmental training and practical research experience in a variety of disciplines related to biomedical research, medical library research, and related fields.

The following objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and practice.\n\nResearch Approaches\nBasic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness, and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design and implement definitive clinical research and \"real world\" outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.\n\nNCCIH\u2019s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.\n\nNCCIH's clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control, observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches. The clinical research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced in \"real-world\" settings.\nIn general, phase III clinical trials will be supported under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff. Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers).\n\nAreas of Special Interest\nFundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms. One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action of natural products, including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota naturally present in the human body. \n\nAnother key goal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of action by which mind and body approaches (including, but not limited to: meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and acupuncture) affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   \n\nA third key goal is to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established methodology. \nNCCIH will also support studies in \"real world\" clinical settings to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their integration into health care. \n\nIndividual behavior plays a key role in health promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  \n\nTop Scientific Priorities\nThe top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond. Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest. Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion and disease prevention across the lifespan.\n\nEarly Stage and New Investigators\nNCCIH is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g., R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds, NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles or scores out of  payline order.\n\nNCCIH continues to accept applications in areas not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities. All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with the relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)","popularName":"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"National Institutes of Health"}},"assistanceTypes":[],"applicantTypes":["Federal","Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes lndian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Specialized Health Research and Training"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Health Research - General"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Education and Training"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Health Services Planning and Technical Assistance"}},{"title":"Science and Technology","subCategory":{"title":"Research - General"}},{"title":"Science and Technology","subCategory":{"title":"Research - Specialized"}}]},{"cfda":"10.051","title":"Commodity Loans and Loan Deficiency Payments","permalink":"/program/10.051","obligations":138823000.0,"objectives":"To improve and stabilize farm income, to assist in bringing about a better balance between supply and demand of the commodities, and to assist farmers in the orderly marketing of their crops.","popularName":"Marketing Assistance Loans (MAL's) and Loan Deficiency Payments (LDP's)","agency":{"title":"Department of Agriculture","subAgency":{"title":"Farm Service Agency"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Loans","Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use"],"applicantTypes":["Individual/Family","Profit organization"],"categories":[{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Stabilization and Conservation Service"}}]},{"cfda":"19.415","title":"Professional and Cultural Exchange Programs - Citizen Exchanges","permalink":"/program/19.415","obligations":138812786.0,"objectives":"Citizen Exchange activities include American Film Showcase, American Music Abroad, Arts Envoy, Center Stage, Community Engagement Exchange, Community Solutions, Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, Fortune - Mentoring Program, Future Leaders Exchange Program, Global Media Makers, Global Sports Mentoring Program, International Sports Programming Initiative, International Writers Program, Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program, Leaders On-Demand, National Security Language Initiative for Youth,  Next Level Hip Hop and Conflict Transformation, OneBeat, Professional Fellows Program, Sports Envoy Program and Sports Visitor Program, Stevens initiative, TechGirls, TechWomen, Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, Young Transatlantic Innovation Leaders Initiative, Youth Leadership Programs, and other Professional and Cultural Exchange programs.","popularName":"Citizen Exchanges","agency":{"title":"Department of State","subAgency":{"title":"Department of State"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Cultural Affairs","subCategory":{"title":"Promotion of the Humanities"}},{"title":"Cultural Affairs","subCategory":{"title":"Promotion of the Arts"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Higher Education - General"}}]},{"cfda":"93.237","title":"Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention and Treatment  Projects","permalink":"/program/93.237","obligations":138700000.0,"objectives":"To promote improved health care among American Indians/Alaska Natives through special diabetes prevention and treatment services with objectives and priorities determined at the local level.

In cases where a State or a Tribe does not have a Primary Enforcement Responsibility program, EPA is authorized to use funds that would have otherwise been made available to the State or the Tribe to assist it in direct implementation of the PWSS program. The fundamental goal of the PWSS Program, and the grants, is to ensure that public water systems comply with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations listed in 40 CFR 141. State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are to use them to ensure that public drinking water systems, of all types, and of all sizes: (1) are currently in compliance with the drinking water regulations and remain in compliance, (2) are working towards and in the process of achieving compliance when these systems are noncompliant, and (3) are preparing for future compliance with any new drinking water regulations that will be taking effect in the current or following year. Furthermore, State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are required to use the funds to update and maintain its PWSS program to comply with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations Implementation requirements listed in 40 CFR 142 to ensure that the State or Tribal PWSS program is capable of conducting oversight of all public water systems as new drinking water rules, new public water systems, and/or drinking water program requirements become effective.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  The priority for the PWSS grants is to ensure that the population served by community water systems will receive drinking water that meets all applicable health-based drinking water standards. This includes ensuring public water systems implement and comply with all drinking water rules, including carefully considering any simultaneous compliance issues. Furthermore, EPA's priority is for States and Tribal PWSS Programs to meet the primary enforcement responsibilities. The primary components of a State or Tribal PWSS program are: (1) the adoption and implementation of State and Indian Tribe drinking water regulations at least as stringent as the Federal regulations; (2) the development and maintenance of database(s) of an inventory of public water systems and housing of public water system compliance information; (3) the conduct of sanitary surveys, which identifies sanitary deficiencies and requires that these deficiencies to be addressed, at public water systems; (4) the establishment and maintenance of a laboratory certification program for approval of laboratories to perform analyses of drinking water contaminants/analytes, including the assurance of adequate laboratory capacity to perform drinking water analyses; (5) the review of public water system plans and specifications; (6) the establishment of legal enforcement and authority to assess penalties to compel public water systems' compliance with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; (7) the adoption of regulations consistent with 40 CFR part 3 which deals with electronic documents; and (8) the adoption and implementation of an adequate plan for providing safe drinking water during emergency circumstances.

Funding may also be used to support the renewal or amendment of existing HCPs, SHAs, and CCAAs.  Funding may be used to support development and planning activities such as document preparation, public outreach, baseline species surveys, habitat assessments, and inventories.  The preparation of environmental compliance review documents, such as National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), is also an eligible use of grant funds.\n\nRecovery Land Acquisition Grants: The principle objective of the RLA Grant program is to promote State and Federal cooperation in listed species conservation by leveraging funds to acquire specific parcels of land, through fee simple or conservation easement, in support of Service-approved recovery plans and outlines.  The ESA conveys the importance of recovery plans as a central organizing tool for guiding the recovery process by requiring their development for every listed species.\n\nHCP Land Acquisition Grants: Established by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 1997, the HCP Land Acquisition Grant program was designed to reduce conflicts between the conservation of listed species and competing land uses on specific parcels of land associated with approved and permitted HCPs. Under this program, the Service provides matching grants to States in support of land acquisition projects that will conserve species habitat in perpetuity through fee simple acquisition or the acquisition of permanent conservation easements. All land acquired through these grants complements, but does not replace, the mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring commitments of the HCP. Thus, this work is additive to the conservation commitments entered into when HCPs are permitted and serves as a meaningful way to leverage non-Federal investment in species recovery and connect conservation lands across the landscape.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of the Interior","subAgency":{"title":"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Natural Resources","subCategory":{"title":"Wildlife Research and Preservation"}}]},{"cfda":"14.896","title":"Family Self-Sufficiency Program","permalink":"/program/14.896","obligations":101127524.0,"objectives":"To promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher, Public Housing and Project-Based Rental Assistance programs with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income and financial literacy, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency.

Factors such as poverty, inadequate housing, poor health care, and other debilitating social conditions, commonly referred to as social determinants of health, contribute to long-standing disparities and health inequities.\nThese social conditions contribute to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US; stroke is the 5th leading cause.  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults who died from CVD were younger than 65 years old. It is estimated that 1 in 9 health care dollars are spent on CVD.   \nCVD mortality rates declined for several decades due to both clinical and public health interventions, but recently declining death rates from both heart disease and stroke have stalled. One reason is that hypertension, the primary risk factor for CVD, is very common (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension) but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.\nGains have been made in treating high cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD. Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10% from 1988\u20131994 to 2017\u20132018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals\u2019 healthy behaviors such as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate prescribing and intensification of medication. Additional public health and health system interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol and blood pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. \nThis program aims to implement and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention and management of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance of health equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities to offer those at risk of or burdened with CVD the best health outcomes possible.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Prevention and Control"}}]},{"cfda":"16.833","title":"National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative","permalink":"/program/16.833","obligations":81424936.0,"objectives":"Goal(s):  Funding under this initiative is intended to help law enforcement and prosecutors address challenges associated with unsubmitted SAKs and unresolved violent crime cold cases in order to reduce the number of unsubmitted SAKs and unresolved cold cases in their jurisdictions.

Under the JRI model, a governmental working group with bipartisan and inter-branch representation analyzes the crime, recidivism, and corrections data, and its associated costs, then develops cost-effective policy and practice options, and implements and measures those changes.\n\n2) Site-based grant awards are made under the \u201cJustice Reinvestment: Reducing Crime by Improving Justice System Performance\u201d grant program, which allows eligible applicants to apply for funding to develop and implement innovative and research-based responses that address a range of criminal justice system problems. Successful applicants are expected to follow the five-step JRI process to meet their objectives: engage stakeholders; analyze data and the current landscape; develop a plan, procedures, and strategies; implement responses; and measure outcomes. \n\n3. \u201cJustice Counts\u201d is a JRI-funded program that provides resources and support to state and local criminal justice agencies to bolster the use of data in policymaking and operational decision-making. The program employs a collaborative approach to develop consensus-driven metrics, a web-based platform for agencies to share their data in line with those metrics, and other associated tools and resources.  \n\n4. The Corrections Data Analysts program provides correctional agencies with much-needed analytical capacity and resources to enhance their ability to use data to drive decision-making. The program includes the development of national, virtual academies to facilitate the training and continuing educations of correctional data analysts as well as a resident corrections analysts program in which funded researchers and analysts will work closely with state correctional leaders to produce needed analyses.   \n\n5. \u201cThe Price of Justice: Rethinking the Consequences of Fines and Fees\u201d program works in partnership with state, local, and tribal agencies to address the use of fines and fees and ensure they are being used in a constitutional and nondiscriminatory way.

To accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following Centers of Excellence (COEs) and associated objectives:\n\nThe Arctic Domain Awareness Center (ADAC) will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime environment issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced team of researchers is required to create an integrated array of research and education programs in the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis, and resilience research; 2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology research.  DHS is interested in pursuing research that will address the needs and technological shortfalls that enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators to respond to catastrophic events.  Greater situational awareness in the Arctic maritime domain, including the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement to prevent and respond to incidents of national significance.\n\nThe Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will conduct end-user focused research to enhance the application of analytic tools to enable the DHS components and offices to realize achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support real-time decision making to address homeland security-related threats and hazards. The research will provide technologies, education and training to improve data management and analysis, to facilitate operations research and systems analysis, to identify the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically assess risks to DHS missions and the people and property they protect. DHS expects this Center to develop the next generation of applied mathematical, computational, and statistical theory (including algorithms and methods), and to advance the quantitative analytical capabilities of DHS components and offices and their partners. This Center also will provide quantitative and analytical tools to administrators, investigators, field operators, and analysts across DHS components.\n\nThe Cross Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations  that detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s people, agriculture, and economy.  This Center\u2019s research will provide innovations and methods to improve biothreat screening and detection, prevention, and support response.  Researchers will seek to understand how advances in bioengineering can support the needs of operators in the field when confronted with emerging threats, both naturally occurring and in situations involving intentional exposures. The Center will also research how to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from diagnostics, genetics, sensors, and the environment. Today\u2019s analysts, first responders, professionals in public and animal health, and operators in the field are confronted with enormous amounts of data which, if understood, could assist in improving our ability to identify threats earlier and make decisions that save lives and the economy.\n\nThe Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center will provide solutions to enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. CINA will develop and conduct research and education programs that will help DHS and its partners enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. The Center will provide education and professional development to improve the cost-effectiveness of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction and prevention. CINA will also develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products, and technology-based solutions for agents, officers and investigators to better coordinate investigative strategies and operations to predict, avert and prosecute trans-national crimes. \n\nThe Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) will conduct research and education that will enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to prepare and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS and its partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect the Nation\u2019s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach, researchers will investigate multiple linked industrial sectors, utilities, and public services. These entities collectively prove critical to business continuity and community recovery within a specific metropolitan area. The place-based approach will allow CIRI to develop solutions to enhance preparedness and recovery of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure systems. Critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n\nThe Coastal Resilience Center (CRC) will conduct research and education to enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic coastal natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The Coastal Resilience Center also will consider future climate trends and their impacts on coastal resilience. Areas of research will include coastal infrastructure resilience, building resilient communities, and disaster dynamics. The overarching goal of the Center will be to advance our understanding of coastal hazards to benefit a large number of public and private entities. DHS anticipates this research will produce tangible research and education results for use by DHS, other federal agencies, state and local governments, and other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat RealitY (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting transportation environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration across public and private entities, and producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded spaces with novel design concepts. There are growing threats from malicious threat actors that target unsecure spaces where they can inflict the gravest injury to human life and property. These threats result in physical, psychological, and financial losses on the individual, collective and societal level to the American population. To address these threats, DHS can make a difference by ensuring future public and private investment in urban infrastructure includes security principals. DHS seeks research that will ensure the Departments long-term needs are considered when infrastructure recapitalization occurs. SENTRY's research will directly support the department\u2019s strategic framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence. The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.\n\nThe Maritime Security Center (MSC) will continue ongoing research and education activities in coordination with U.S. Coast Guard and other customers to facilitate transition of appropriate projects to DHS components and advance integrated education efforts. MSC research projects focus on the following areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis, and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology Research; and Integration of Science and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance and Policy Research. In addition to pursuing key research and education initiatives based on DHS challenges, the Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge, technical skills, and leadership capabilities of the Nation\u2019s current and prospective maritime security workforce. At the core of the Center\u2019s mission is the transfer of its research and expertise into relevant, innovative educational programs.

The 28 estuaries of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed, develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners, including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands; supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing strategies to provide opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served communities to have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational activities. In addition to CCMP implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients, address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. NEP projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA, Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), should seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure that benefits reach disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities to climate change, and leverage additional resources, including from other IIJA programs. After approval of each estuary program\u2019s equity strategy, EPA will waive non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024 \u2013 FY 2026 IIJA funds. The purpose of the equity strategy is to ensure that each NEP is reviewing potential projects and utilization of IIJA funds through the lens of equitable and fair access to the benefits from environmental programs for all individuals. The equity strategy should outline how IIJA funds will be utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged communities and the benefits that flow to them.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: EPA's funding priority is to award assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs' (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds' priority problems identified in each of the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address priority problems identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments and environmental results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials' capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and 4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In FY 2023, EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary organization to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal and estuarine areas.","popularName":"NEP","agency":{"title":"Environmental Protection Agency","subAgency":null},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Interstate","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[{"title":"Environmental Quality","subCategory":{"title":"Water Pollution Control"}}]},{"cfda":"93.435","title":"The Innovative Cardiovascular Health Program","permalink":"/program/93.435","obligations":35983121.0,"objectives":"This program purpose is referencing unequal socioeconomic conditions and unfair opportunity structures have long existed and contribute to poor health outcomes in minority and ethnic populations and geographically and economically disadvantaged communities. Poverty, inferior housing and health care, and other debilitating social conditions are endemic to some communities, including Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Native American communities.  \nResearch highlights the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension, high cholesterol, and stroke in these groups. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US and stroke is the 5th leading cause with an estimated 1 in 9 health care dollars spent treating CVD. Despite significant decreases in CVD rates in the last 20 years, NHB continue to have higher CVD mortality rates than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). In 2019, NHB women and men younger than 65 were 2.0 and 1.3 times more likely to experience premature death from CVD than their NHW counterparts. In 2020, NHB had the highest heart disease mortality rates at 228.6 per 100,000 and stroke at 56.8 per 100,000.  \nUncontrolled hypertension is the primary contributor to morbidity and mortality rate disparities in CVD between NHB and other racial and ethnic groups. In 2019, NHB had more than double the age-adjusted death rates (56.7) attributable primarily to hypertension compared to NHW (25.7). \nOf the 1 in 2 US adults with hypertension, only 26.1% have controlled blood pressure. By age 55, the cumulative incidence of hypertension reaches almost 76% in NHB men and women, compared to 54.5% and 40.0% among NHW men and women, respectively. Moreover, NHB had a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for hypertension after adjustment for other factors, regardless of baseline blood pressure. Among NHB adults who did not report a hypertension diagnosis, a larger proportion (28%) were unaware of hypertension (BP \u2265140/90 mm Hg) compared to NHW adults (16%). Despite the similar rate of hypertension treatment, only one-third of NHB adults had their blood pressure controlled, in contrast to 45.0% of NHW adults. These data clearly indicate that NHB bear the greatest burden of CVD among US adults.  \nThe outcomes are as stark in other CVD-related illnesses. Although the prevalence of high cholesterol in NHB is comparable to or lower than in NHW, racial-ethnic disparities occur at every level of diagnosis and management. The disparities present in low screening rates, fewer prescriptions, and medication adherence. Unsatisfactory control of high cholesterol among NHB stems from the same adverse social conditions that hinder the control of hypertension. \nInterventions must include an understanding of individual and community factors that influence a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication adherence to address the disparities and inequities. There is a need for equity-focused health system interventions to prevent, detect, control, and manage hypertension and high cholesterol. Building on lessons from the previous work, this program focuses on comprehensive efforts to identify and respond to health care disparities and improve CVD-related outcomes, specifically for those with hypertension and high cholesterol. \nPopulations of focus for this program are adults aged 18 and older with a hypertension crude prevalence of 53% or higher, as shown by data specifically at the census tract level.  Emphasis should be placed on achieving impact and reach across geographic locations where disparate populations can benefit from the strategies included in this program.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"General Health and Medical"}}]},{"cfda":"10.448","title":"Rural Development Multi-Family Housing Rural Housing Voucher Program","permalink":"/program/10.448","obligations":35780670.0,"objectives":"The Rural Housing Voucher Demonstration program is designed to provide rental housing assistance vouchers to tenants in properties that pay off their Rural Development mortgage.

The goal of the National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that will assure protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda, has a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound Estuary's environment by meeting 2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. This program has the following main objectives: First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest priority work as articulated in every four-year updates to the Action Agenda work plan. The updated work plan identifies implementation strategies to achieve reductions in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Science Work Plan which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed in order for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is to support implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical studies and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities and help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management of the program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of Puget Sound. The program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2021-2026 : Funding will be continued for the three strategic initiative leads (SILs) which will  focus on: Award and manage subawards to support the implementation of the Action Agenda with a focus on Implementation Strategies; maintain Strategic Initiative Advisory Teams (SIATs) to advise in investment-related decision-making; serve as Implementation Strategy Leads for Vital Signs related to the Strategic Initiative and form technical (e.g., Interdisciplinary Teams) and/or policy workgroups to develop, refine, adaptively manage, and operationalize Implementation Strategies; participate in the Puget Sound Partnership and National Estuary Program (NEP) Management Conference processes and work groups; and proactively coordinate with tribal partners and Local Integrating Organizations (LIOs) in order to accomplish SIL work.

The Off-Range management goal is to ensure the health and welfare of wild horses and burros that were removed from public lands under BLM care, to place animals into private care through adoptions, sales, and transfers, to conduct compliance inspections of adopted animals and to build partnerships and relationships with external organizations.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Efforts in Lake Champlain will continue to support the successful interstate, interagency, and international partnership undertaking the implementation of Opportunities for Action, a plan designed to protect and where necessary restore the lake's water quality, sustain healthy ecosystems in the basin, support thriving communities and inform and involve the public in lake issues and activities. Financial awards under this program are made to the States of Vermont and New York, and to the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC) to implement Opportunities for Action. Congress directed EPA to allocate $25,000,000 for the Lake Champlain program via the Appropriations Act of 2023. These funds shall be allocated through the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP), other than $8,000,000, which shall be directed to support significant, impactful projects identified in the 52 state implementation plan that will make measurable progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction targets of the EPA's 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain. Funding priorities include phosphorus reduction, cyanobacteria control, water quality monitoring to track progress and alerts to the public if unsafe conditions exist, implementation of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program as authorized by the Vessel Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115\u2013282), aquatic invasive species prevention and control, habitat protection and restoration, and environmental education and outreach. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the LCBP received $8 million for FY23 through CWA Section 120. These allocations are expected to continue for five years through FY26. The Lake Champlain priorities for funding include increased technical assistance, capacity, and implementation funding to support aquatic organism passage, floodplain restoration and flood mitigation, use of natural infrastructure, and habitat restoration and conservation programs that have the potential to support traditionally underserved communities and/or will mitigate the impacts of climate change.

On an annual based Congress has only provided appropriations to CED and RCD programs. NIP has never received funding. CED program provides awards on a competitive basis to private, nonprofit organizations that are community development corporations (CDCs). The CDC provides technical and financial assistance for economic development activities that address the economic needs of individuals and families with low income, through the creation of sustainable business development and employment opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial developments and equity investments or loans to capitalize a new business or expand an existing business, so the businesses can create new, full-time permanent jobs for individuals with low incomes. CED allows communities to drive the type of investment and/or business to that which is most needed in the community. Seventy-five percent of the jobs created must be filled by individuals that are below 200% of HHS poverty guideline. In addition to the CED Projects Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), CED has published three additional NOFOs that support communities with low-income that create business and job opportunities: (1) CED Focus on Social Enterprise (CED-SE); (2) CED Focus on Energy Communities (CED-Energy); and (3) CED Planning Grant (CED-Planning). All the initiatives have the same objectives of the CED program: to create economic mobility opportunities for individuals with low-income. The CED-Energy and the CED-Planning awards are aligned with President Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad and the Justice40 initiative. The CED-Energy program supports efforts to empower workers by revitalizing energy communities. Energy communities are communities that have experienced employment loss and/or economic dislocation events because of declines in the fossil fuel industry and/or are disproportionately reliant on fossil fuel energy production or distribution, including coal, oil, gas, and power plant communities across the country. The CED-Planning initiative is to stimulate the development of new CED projects through the provision of resources that are used to support administrative and capacity building. The RCD program provides awards to multistate, regional, and tribal nonprofit organizations that provides training and technical assistance to small, rural communities for the improvement of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. RCD helps community members identify and address water and wastewater related issues, including infrastructure and accessibility needs; increase access for families with low incomes to water supply and waste disposal services; preserve affordable water and waste disposal services in low-income rural communities; train water operators to ensure water systems comply with federal regulations; increase local capacity and expertise to establish and maintain needed water facilities; increase economic opportunities for low-income rural communities by ensuring they have basic water and sanitation; utilize technical assistance to leverage additional public and private resources; promote improved coordination of federal, state, and local agencies and financing programs to benefit low-income communities; and help communities establish financial stability and financial reserves to maintain water delivery and wastewater disposal systems.","popularName":"Community Economic Development  & Rural Community Programs","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Administration for Children and Families"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Stabilization and Conservation Service"}},{"title":"Business and Commerce","subCategory":{"title":"Economic Development"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Planning and Research"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Rural Community Development"}},{"title":"Employment, Labor, and Training","subCategory":{"title":"Assistance to State and Local Governments"}}]},{"cfda":"10.707","title":"Research Joint Venture and Cost Reimbursable Agreements","permalink":"/program/10.707","obligations":27740072.0,"objectives":"To increase participation by partners in Agricultural rangeland and forestry research activities, agricultural formal teaching activities, and agricultural extension services.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Department of Agriculture","subAgency":{"title":"Forest Service"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments for a Specified Use"],"applicantTypes":["Federal","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Research and Development"}}]},{"cfda":"10.351","title":"Rural Business Development Grant","permalink":"/program/10.351","obligations":27691376.0,"objectives":"To promote sustainable economic development and facilitate the development of small and emerging private business, industry, and related employment for improving the economy in rural communities.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Assistance agreements to states under Section 2007 of the Solid Waste and Disposal Act will support core program UST activities, implement their leak prevention and detection programs, as well as the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPAct) leak prevention activities. High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to states for the following: 1) adopting and implementing EPA's recently-released regulatory revisions; 2) approving specific technologies to detect leaks from tank systems; 3) ensuring that tank owners and operators are complying with notification and other requirements; 4) ensuring equipment compatibility; 5) conducting UST inspections; 6) implementing operator training; 7) prohibiting delivery for non-complying facilities; 8) seeking state program approval to operate the UST program in lieu of the federal program; and 9) requiring secondary containment. Leaking underground storage tank (LUST) prevention assistance agreements to states, tribes, or intertribal consortia for activities authorized by EPAct will support states with inspections and other release prevention and compliance assurance activities for federally regulated UST systems, as well as for enforcement activities related to release prevention. A main cause of releases is the lack of proper operation and maintenance of UST systems, which is why the EPA published revised UST regulations in FY 2015 that address these and other important issues. These changes will require subsequent state adoption, applicable updates to state regulations, and updates to state program approval. For tribes, the LUST prevention assistance agreements will assist with all aspects of the tribal programs, e.g., inspection capacity. High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to tribes for: 1) inspecting UST facilities to complete the three-year inspection requirement; 2) developing inspection capacity for tribes; 3) enforcement activities related to release prevention; 4) development of leak prevention regulations and other program infrastructure; 5) helping tribes develop the capacity to administer UST programs, such as providing funding to support training for tribal staff and educating owners and operators in Indian country about UST requirements. These activities are geared toward bringing all UST systems into compliance with release detection and release prevention requirements and minimizing future releases. Priority will be given to providing funds to enable the states to meet their responsibilities under Title XV, Subtitle B of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Advances in telehealth are transforming health care from a service delivered through traditional brick and mortar health care facilities to connected care options delivered via a broadband Internet access connection directly to the patient\u2019s home or mobile location. Despite the numerous benefits of connected care services, patients who cannot afford or who otherwise lack reliable, robust broadband Internet access connectivity, including many low-income Americans and veterans, are not realizing the benefits of these innovative telehealth technologies. The costs necessary to provide connected care services may also limit some health care providers\u2019 ability to treat patients, particularly low-income Americans and veterans, with connected care services. To address this, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) established the Connected Care Pilot Program (Pilot Program) within the Universal Service Fund (USF or Fund) to provide funding up to $100 million over three years and to examine how the Fund can help support the trend towards connected care services, particularly for low-income Americans and veterans. The Pilot Program was set up to help defray eligible health care providers\u2019 costs of providing connected care services, with a particular emphasis on supporting these services for eligible low-income Americans and veterans. The Commission expects that the Pilot Program will benefit many low-income and veteran patients who are responding to a wide variety of health challenges such as public health epidemics, opioid dependency, mental health conditions, high-risk pregnancy, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and heart disease. The Commission also expects that the Pilot Program will provide meaningful data that will help better understand how USF funds can support health care provider and patient use of connected care services, and how supporting health care provider and patient use of connected care services can improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.","popularName":"Connected Care Pilot Program","agency":{"title":"Federal Communications Commission","subAgency":null},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments for a Specified Use"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Indian Health"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Mental Health"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"General Health and Medical"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Veterans Health"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Health Services Planning and Technical Assistance"}}]},{"cfda":"10.311","title":"Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program","permalink":"/program/10.311","obligations":19000000.0,"objectives":"The primary goal of BFRDP is to help beginning farmers and ranchers in the United States and its territories enter and/or improve their successes in farming, ranching, and management of nonindustrial private forest lands, through support for projects that provide education, mentoring, and technical assistance to give beginning farmers and ranchers the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to make informed decisions for their operations and enhance their sustainability.

The CBVP Program supports effective use of focused deterrence (enforcement) strategies and public health and education approaches to stop violence. This will be accomplished by supporting communities to establish and strengthen partnerships between law enforcement and outreach workers, clergy, community leaders and family members in efforts to deter young people from committing violence, particularly shootings and killings.

The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) is the Action Agenda. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. The Puget Sound Protection and Restoration: Tribal Implementation Assistance Program is aimed at assisting the Indian Tribes of the greater Puget Sound basin in their efforts to carry out work critically needed for Puget Sound protection and restoration. This work includes activities identified in, or consistent with, the Action Agenda such as efforts called for by established salmon recovery plans in the Puget Sound basin. EPA has a trust responsibility to Federally recognized Indian Tribes. EPA also recognizes that Federally recognized Indian Tribes in the greater Puget Sound basin have a critical role in the protection and restoration of the ecosystem and its resources. EPA seeks to provide financial assistance to these Tribes to help them implement priority strategies and actions in or consistent with the approved Clean Water Act \u00a7320 CCMP for Puget Sound. Program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds.

ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform, engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013 including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual dignity while building international knowledge and capacity among Americans. The EducationUSA network promotes U.S. higher education and facilitates student mobility by providing guidance and support to both prospective student audiences abroad and U.S. higher education institutions that seek to recruit and enroll these students.  EducationUSA also supports both international and domestic student success by research by engaging U.S. higher education institutions to ensure that students' experiences on U.S. campuses are academically engaging, culturally enriching, include diverse, global perspectives in the classroom, and create lasting ties between individuals today that will support stronger relations between nations tomorrow.  The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) oversees the EducationUSA network, which consists of over 430 international student advising centers in more than 175 countries worldwide. The EducationUSA network supports ECA\u2019s mission by increasing international student mobility, providing students from across the globe with access to educational opportunities, and building a broader understanding of the U.S. higher education sector among overseas student, government and academic personnel. EducationUSA advising centers are housed within U.S. embassies and consulates and/or in partner institutions that include Fulbright Commissions, bi-national cultural centers, U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international NGOs, and/or universities and libraries abroad. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance and support to international students and their families as they explore opportunities to study at U.S. college and universities. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance on the U.S. higher education admissions process and offer accurate, comprehensive, and current information about the full range of accredited U.S. institutions of higher education. Advising activities are conducted via center activities, in-person and virtual outreach in local communities, including webinars, virtual recruitment fairs, and website content.

A critical aspect of this framework is the integration of physical processes, water quality, and critical habitat at a regional, watershed, and/or landscape scale. SNEP's Strategic Plan under this framework includes goals for achieving, 1. a resilient ecosystem of safe and healthy waters, 2. thriving watersheds and natural lands, and 3. sustainable communities. Additional background information on SNEP can be found at the following website: www.epa.gov/snep. EPA intends to fund projects, either directly or via a pass-through organization, that address SNEP priorities and spur investments in regionally significant and landscape scale restoration projects through projects, networks, and/or partnerships among governmental and community resource managers, technology, scientific, and policy organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), tribes, and other groups. A major focus is to build regional capacity for environmental management, including developing and establishing robust institutional, monitoring, information, and technology frameworks that can offer more effective, transferable, and sustainable paths to restoring and protecting the southeast New England coastal watersheds. Through competitive funding announcements, EPA will outline specific program priorities and eligible activities in areas such as environmental, ecological, and/or habitat restoration planning and construction; ordinance adoption and implementation; technology and policy development, testing, and adoption; financing; monitoring, including methods, equipment, data analysis and interpretation; public understanding and engagement; technical training in new approaches; information sharing; implementation of nature-based solutions; and targeted/applied research. EPA may seek to fund this work directly or through an eligible pass-through organization and will provide project examples and expectations in specific Request for Applications (RFAs).  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  This program seeks to restore improve water quality, habitat health and resilience in the SNEP region by building capacity of local communities, tribes and organizations and by providing grants to support planning, demonstration, design and implementation of best management practices, monitoring and evaluation of innovative approaches and development of new technologies. SNEP funding is provided to support technical assistance and implementation grants through direct EPA awards, the SNEP Network, Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program, Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, SNEP Watershed Implementation Grants and/or a SNEP Pilot Watersheds Initiative.

EPA may give special consideration to HIA projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing Climate, Disaster Resiliency, and/or Emergency Preparedness \u2013 The effects of climate change and extreme weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations disproportionately.

This includes over $23 billion dollars in program payments through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to eligible producers to offset the financial impacts of the pandemic on American agriculture. FSA has made and continues to make a concerted effort to reach producers who are new to farming and new to working with USDA to ensure eligible producers receive the support they need. Many of the producers who participated in CFAP, particularly CFAP 2 due to increased support for specialty crops, were participating in a disaster program for the first time.\n\nMany producers are not aware that receiving funds from USDA through activities such as an EQIP contract, disaster payments, and the pending debt relief legislation payments creates a tax liability for their farm business. Often producers who receive financial support from USDA do not have the technical knowledge or understanding of how USDA program payments are treated for tax purposes or where to get support regarding tax questions. Taxpayer education has been a longstanding issue in the agricultural community. There is a dearth of preparers in rural areas, many producers are not knowledgeable about agricultural taxes, and producers do not have the knowledge or resources necessary to integrate tax planning into their farm financial planning process. USDA frequently works with historically underserved, beginning, and limited resource producers who lack access to legal and certified public accounting services or who are unfamiliar with agricultural accounting best practices.\n\nTo address these issues the Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with a variety of cooperators through cooperative agreements to develop and deliver taxpayer education to producers and key stakeholders.

An increasing number of jobs that require STEM skills do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree, and other education and training pathways \u2013 such as apprenticeships, fellowships, and other work-based learning models  \u2013 are becoming instrumental in meeting the urgent demand for a STEM-capable workforce.  \nTo meet these demands, Section 28 of Stevenson-Wydler (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723), authorizes EDA to carry out a grant program to identify and develop strategies that support the growth of STEM talent development programs, and to implement those programs where plans and strategies exist.","popularName":"STEM Talent Challenge","agency":{"title":"Department of Commerce","subAgency":{"title":"Economic Development Administration"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federal","Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Government - General","Interstate","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes lndian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Agricultural","subCategory":{"title":"Technical Assistance, Information and Services"}},{"title":"Business and Commerce","subCategory":{"title":"Economic Injury and Natural Disaster"}},{"title":"Business and Commerce","subCategory":{"title":"Special Technical Service"}},{"title":"Business and Commerce","subCategory":{"title":"Economic Development"}},{"title":"Community Development","subCategory":{"title":"Technical Assistance and Services"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Resource Development and Support - Sciences"}},{"title":"Education","subCategory":{"title":"Vocational Development"}},{"title":"Employment, Labor, and Training","subCategory":{"title":"Job Training, Employment"}},{"title":"Employment, Labor, and Training","subCategory":{"title":"Planning, Research, and Demonstration"}},{"title":"Employment, Labor, and Training","subCategory":{"title":"Program Development"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Specialized Health Research and Training"}},{"title":"Health","subCategory":{"title":"Education and Training"}},{"title":"Income Security and Social Services","subCategory":{"title":"Training Assistance"}},{"title":"Regional Development","subCategory":{"title":"Planning and Technical Assistance"}},{"title":"Regional Development","subCategory":{"title":"Education"}},{"title":"Regional Development","subCategory":{"title":"Economic Development"}},{"title":"Science and Technology","subCategory":{"title":"Information and Technical"}}]},{"cfda":"10.593","title":"Bill Emerson National Hunger Fellows and Mickey Leland International Hunger Fellows Programs","permalink":"/program/10.593","obligations":2000000.0,"objectives":"The Bill Emerson Hunger Fellowship Program is to address hunger and poverty in the United States.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: SRA assistance agreements must carry out activities within the terms of EPA's statutory authorities. The statutes allow the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements that use technical assistance methods of: research, investigation, experiments, education, training, studies, and/or demonstration of innovative techniques to perform source reduction work. SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this \"learning\" concept, as opposed to \"fixing\" an environmental problem using a well-established method.

A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration. In addition, projects must demonstrate how source reduction approaches are new or experimental and how the project otherwise meets the requirements of a demonstration as described in the applicable SRA grant announcement.

The applicant must also explain what will be learned from the demonstration. If the project is truly a demonstration and complies with other eligibility and grant threshold factors, then it will be considered for funding.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) will be working closely with the EPA as co-regulators through the jointly governed Combined Air Emissions Reporting (CAERS) Product Design Team (PDT) established under E-Enterprise for the Environment. States will continue to use this existing forum to share information with EPA and ensure that state interests, needs, and issues are adequately addressed by the CAERS project. ECOS will work in close cooperation with the chairs and members of the CAERS Product Development Team (PDT) to plan and execute this work and increase the value of CAERS for states interested in onboarding. ECOS will conduct research to better understand the extent of alignment among data fields used by states, locals, tribes, (SLTs) and EPA relevant to source tests for the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). The research will investigate which SLT-specific programs require source test data reporting from their industry for their emissions inventory. Researchers will seek to document how states intake and/or use source test data reports from industry at the facility and unit/process levels for use in emission inventories where \u201cstack test\u201d is the calculation method. ECOS will support work with state environmental agencies through the ECOS Water Committee to convene the appropriate state environmental leaders to work on water issues, improve communication and partnership with EPA, and coordinate with other state water associations. ECOS will especially seek to support states in engaging in the robust regulatory agenda being pursued by the Office of Water and help coordinate partnership on those topics between states and EPA. ECOS will support EPA in moving forward with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) implementation and priorities like Justice40 as they relate to the State Revolving Fund programs. Advance the ECOS Member priority to support small and disadvantaged systems. Support the ECOS Infrastructure Workgroup. ECOS intends to bring states together through the Climate and Energy Workgroup to discuss with EPA the implications, opportunities, and challenges for states. Input from ECOS and its members will help EPA shape durable and equitable climate solutions.

An additional key purpose for the HSPTAP is that the program also furthers the building of a national system of emergency management capabilities that can effectively and efficiently utilize the full measure of the Nation's resources to respond to catastrophic incidents, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made emergencies or events. HSPTAP recipients will conduct activities that bring together the collective perspectives of state and local elected officials and the private sector to provide a broad-based sounding board on homeland security issues for all national stakeholders. The program will serve to establish, provide, and maintain a forum for organizations to exchange ideas, conduct targeted discussions, as well as to provide technical assistance to governors\u2019 offices, associations and organizations on all relevant homeland security policy areas. Finally, HSPTAP will engage the recipient organizations which can work closely with FEMA to develop, transfer, and institutionalize pertinent knowledge at the State and local level for addressing current public policy challenges facing State EM Directors, HSAs and other state and local emergency management officials. HSPTAP recipients, through collaboration with FEMA and other national, regional, state and local entities, will facilitate focused and enhanced communication and coordination among all disciplines and levels of government to address the complex challenges of developing and implementing homeland security policies and practices including: intelligence sharing; State homeland security organization, structure and governance; communications interoperability; critical infrastructure protection; and all hazards disaster prevention, protection, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to include areas of emergency management, homeland security, fire, law enforcement, Emergency Management Services (EMS), agriculture, National Guard, emergency communications, and public works.

Congress included emergency funding in the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43). ERP\u2019s first round of disaster funding provided payments to producers using existing data and did not require outreach because producers were automatically enrolled in the program. The second phase of ERP is aimed at filling gaps and providing assistance to producers who did not participate in or receive payments through the existing risk management programs that were leveraged for phase 1 implementation. \n\nPhase 2 of ERP will provide assistance to producers who suffered losses due to qualifying natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. This program will be revenue based and will require participation in a risk management program for the next two crop years. These eligibility criteria and risk management linkage requirements create unique needs around outreach and technical assistance for this program. Producers will need to supply information to FSA that would typically be found on their Schedule F tax forms, and if they have not filed a Schedule F, be able to supply acceptable revenue records or create the required application data from their own farm records.  Producers will also need to identify and enroll in the appropriate risk management program for their operation.\n \nThe assistance ERP program participants will need in order to supply application information will be unique to their individual operation and tax situation, and more technical than the information we typically provide as part of general outreach and program education. As a result, the communication, technical support, and outreach strategies around ERP for producers need to be focused, targeted and technical in nature. This program also offers the opportunity to connect with producers who have not worked with their local FSA office, and an opportunity to not only participate in ERP but also serve as a gateway to risk management tools and other FSA and USDA programs and services. FSA has $8 million available for cooperative agreements to provide outreach and technical assistance for the Emergency Relief Program Phase 2. \n\nThe Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with stakeholder organizations to effectively reach producers, including those that are small, underserved, and not currently participating in existing programs who did not apply under phase 1 of the ERP program.

For more information on the AIM Act and its implementing regulations, please visit https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction.  \n\nThe objectives of these grants are to support and contribute to addressing HFCs under the AIM Act by funding three project areas: (1) Reclaim Technologies - pilot projects or proofs of concept for new/better technologies to increase the reclamation of HFCs by expanding access to reclamation and improving the reclamation process; (2) Reclaim Market Dynamics - programs or pilot projects for innovative strategies that address market dynamics to increase HFC reclamation by lowering barriers; and (3) Innovative Destruction Technologies - pilot projects/proof of concept for innovative technologies or innovative deployment of technologies to destroy unusable and unwanted HFCs. \n\nSuccessful implementation of these funds by grantees will result in the advancement of improved technologies and/or deployment of technologies for HFC reclamation and destruction and identification of successful mechanisms to address barriers to HFC reclamation.  In addition, successful projects will thoughtfully engage with, provide benefits to, and mitigate any potential negative impacts to low income and disadvantaged communities in project design and implementation.

EPA will prioritize projects that are leveraged with other sources of funding, to increase the impact of the grants and increase the amount of reclaimed or destroyed HFCs. EPA also will prioritize projects that thoughtfully engage with communities, especially those that are underserved or overburdened, in project design and implementation and work to actively mitigate any unintended negative impacts to those communities.","popularName":"","agency":{"title":"Environmental Protection Agency","subAgency":null},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized lndian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated lndian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes lndian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"10.974","title":"DSA COVID Relief Program","permalink":"/program/10.974","obligations":0.0,"objectives":"The DSA COVID Relief Program will provide assistance to distressed direct farm loan borrowers who received a Disaster Set-Aside (DSA) on their FSA farm loan during the COVID-19 pandemic.","popularName":"DSACOVRP","agency":{"title":"Department of Agriculture","subAgency":{"title":"Farm Service Agency"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use"],"applicantTypes":["Individual/Family"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"11.408","title":"Fishermen's Contingency Fund","permalink":"/program/11.408","obligations":0.0,"objectives":"To compensate U.S. commercial fishermen for damage/loss of fishing gear and 50 percent of resulting economic loss due to oil and gas related activities in any area of the Outer Continental Shelf.","popularName":"Fisheries Contingency Fund","agency":{"title":"Department of Commerce","subAgency":{"title":"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}},"assistanceTypes":["Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use"],"applicantTypes":["Individual/Family","Profit organization"],"categories":[{"title":"Business and Commerce","subCategory":{"title":"Commercial Fisheries"}}]},{"cfda":"66.959","title":"Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: Section 134(a)(1) - Zero Emission Technologies Grant Program","permalink":"/program/66.959","obligations":0.0,"objectives":"Section 60103 of Public Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (August 16, 2022), commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added Section 134 to the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7434, to establish the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).
