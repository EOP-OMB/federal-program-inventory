  Federal-aid Highway Program is to assist the States in providing for construction,
  preservation, and improvement of highways and bridges on eligible Federal-Aid routes,
  (including the National Highway System (NHS) - an integrated, interconnected transportation
  system important to interstate commerce and travel), and for other special purpose
  programs and projects.  This program also provides for the construction and improvement
  of highways in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the
  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\n2)
  The Federal Lands Highway Program: The Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP)
  provides assistance to the Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) for Federally-owned
  roads and trails. It provides transportation engineering services and funding for
  planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges that
  are on or provide access to federally owned lands. The Federal Lands Highway organization
  also provides training, technology deployment, and engineering services to other
  customers. \n\n3) The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (IIJA) Act also known as
  the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is a once-in-a-generation investment in
  our infrastructure that will help grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness,
  create good jobs, and build our safe, resilient, and equitable transportation future.  BIL
  provides the basis for FHWA programs and activities through September 30, 2026.  It
  makes an investment of $350 billion in highway programs. This includes the largest
  dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  New
  programs under the BIL focus on key infrastructure priorities including rehabilitating
  bridges in critical need of repair, reducing carbon emissions, increasing system
  resilience, removing barriers to connecting communities, and improving mobility
  and access to economic opportunity.  Many of the new programs include eligibility
  for local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Tribes, and other
  public authorities, allowing them to compete directly for funding.  BIL also continues
  to focus the program on safety and performance-based investment and on accelerating
  project delivery through expedited environmental review and elimination of duplicate
  processes.\n\n4) The Highway Infrastructure Programs in the Department of Transportation
  Appropriations Act, 2018, included two new discretionary programs:  Competitive
  Bridge Program and Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program.  The
  Competitive Bridge Program was appropriated $225 million to be used for highway
  bridge rehabilitation or replacement projects for States that have a population
  density of less than 100 individuals per square mile and that demonstrate cost savings
  by bundling multiple highway bridge projects.","permalink":"/program/20.205","agency":"Department

  8 Housing Choice Vouchers","objective":"The housing choice voucher program is the
  federal government''s major program for assisting very low-income families, the
  elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private
  market. Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual,
  participants are able to find their own housing, including single-family homes,
  townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets
  the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized
  housing projects. The program serves the most economically vulnerable families in
  the country, including families with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless
  veterans, and families with children, through federal assistance voucher payments
  in the provision of meeting their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the
  former Section 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate
  program (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose
  of the legislation is \"consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental
  assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the \"USHA\")
  into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental
  assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing
  and will increase housing choice for low-income families\". The HCVP is administered
  by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate housing

  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer the voucher
  program. The PHA accepts a family\u2019s application for rental assistance, selects
  the applicant family for admission, and issues the selected family a voucher confirming
  the family\u2019s eligibility for assistance. The family must then find and lease
  a dwelling unit suitable to the family\u2019s needs and desires in the private rental
  market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant Payment contracts with the landlords, and
  housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating
  family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the
  landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances,
  if authorized by the PHA, a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.","permalink":"/program/14.871","agency":"Department

  recognized tribal reservations and migratory farm workers.  The program is designed
  to involve parents in their child\u2019s learning and development, and to help parents
  make progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start
  also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of
  their local Head Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards outline
  the requirements and expectations of programs in delivering these services.  Head
  Start programs are expected to collaborate with other early care and education programs
  in their communities, and to work closely with local school systems to continue
  the gains children achieve in Head Start.\n\nThrough Early Head Start programming,
  the focus includes the development of children, and the enabling of parents to fulfill
  their roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These programs promote the physical,
  cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe
  and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth
  and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals,
  programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system
  (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives of
  the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications
  and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\nSince 2014 through
  Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs for
  infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start programs
  or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers who agree
  to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  \n\nThe Office of Head Start
  Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge, skills, and
  practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn, improve the outcomes
  of children and families. The system includes four National Centers, each with an
  area of focus that collaborate effectively to support and promote consistent practices

  The FAA Office of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute
  to these goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial
  Information. \n\nThe ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient
  national airports system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S.,
  with considerations for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights,
  and safeguarding the public investment. As an important component of that mission,
  ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants
  contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety,
  capacity, efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability.
  The program objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators
  of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate
  to meet the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable
  to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection,
  and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants
  to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including Executive
  Order 13985 \u2013 \u201cExecutive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support
  for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government\u201d, Executive Order
  14005 \u2013 \u201cEnsuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America\u2019s

  at Home and Abroad\u201d (as listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance
  measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement: In the mission
  area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative
  on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure
  is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport
  inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe
  and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent,
  Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is
  ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent
  of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS).
  The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the
  capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are
  required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA
  Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form
  5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting
  on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects.
  With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within
  that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and
  grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of
  performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project
  completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number
  of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant
  funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with
  and is reported on in the FAA\u2019s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.","permalink":"/program/20.106","agency":"Department

  by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)  is for capitalization grants to each state
  for infrastructure improvement projects that are needed to address the most serious
  risk to human health, are necessary to  achieve or maintain compliance with SDWA
  requirements, and assist systems most in need on a per household basis according
  to State affordability criteria.  A state may use a portion of the capitalization
  grant funds for programs emphasizing contamination prevention through technical
  assistance, capacity development, operator certification, and source water protection.
  \n\nThe program supports the Agency''s strategic goal of providing for clean and
  safe water.\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 2021, (Public
  Law 117-58), makes available additional capitalization grants to each state and
  construction grants to the other listed entities for the purpose of providing assistance
  through the Drinking Water SRF to: (1) activities identified above, (2) activities
  identified above for projects that address emerging contaminants in drinking water,
  and (3) activities identified above for projects that identify and replace lead
  service lines (including related planning and design projects and activities).\n\nThe
  capitalization grant is deposited in the State''s DWSRF, which is used to provide
  loans and other types of financial assistance to public water systems as described
  in Section 1452 of the SDWA. A maximum of four percent of the grant amounts, $400,000
  each year, or 1/5 percent per year of the current valuation (total net position)
  of the fund, whichever is greatest, may be used by the States for the cost of administering
  the DWSRF. States may discretionally take other \u201cset-asides\u201d for small
  system technical assistance, state program management, and local assistance as described
  in Section 1452 of the SDWA. States determine priorities for funding within their
  State in accordance with the SDWA.\n\nFor the 51 State DWSRFs, a portion of the
  capitalization grant funding must be used to provide additional subsidy in the form
  of grants, principal forgiveness, or negative interest loans.","permalink":"/program/66.468","agency":"Environmental

  Mandatory and Matching portion (or Child Care Entitlement or CCE) of the Child Care
  and Development Fund (CCDF) program consists of Mandatory funds (which are 100%
  federal) and Matching funds (which require a State match and maintenance of effort).  The
  Mandatory and Matching funds are made available in section 418 of the Social Security
  Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are not subject to annual appropriations. Allocations of
  the Mandatory Funds are based on a State''s Federal share of the expenditures for
  the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child Care, Transitional
  Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the average of 1992 through
  1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to expend any State funds in
  order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. Previously, the Mandatory and
  Matching funds provided about $2.9 billion in federal funding per year for child
  care.  The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) was enacted March
  11, 2021 and appropriated $3,550,000,000 (Section 9801) in mandatory and matching
  funding for CCDF, which is a permanent annual appropriation effective fiscal year
  2021. The appropriation includes $3.375 billion to States, $75 million to Territories
  (previously not eligible), and $100 million to Tribes. \n To access Matching Funds,
  a State must obligate all of its Mandatory Funds allotted in a fiscal year and maintain
  100% of the State''s share of expenditures for the former programs in fiscal year
  1994 or fiscal year 1995, whichever is greater (i.e., maintenance of effort). Matching
  Funds must be matched at the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)
  rate, which is the Medicaid Program matching rate. The Matching Funds are distributed
  based on the number of children under age 13 in a State compared with the national
  total of children under age 13.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2)
  appropriated $3.375 billion in CCDF Mandatory and Matching funds to States. Because
  the state Mandatory fund amount remains fixed in law, the $512,250,000 increase
  appropriated to states by the ARP Act are awarded in Matching funds. Matching funds
  are available to states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year
  in which the funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state\u2019s
  Maintenance-of-Effort funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of
  Matching funds at the FMAP rate. However, states are not required to match the additional
  funds awarded in section 9801 of the ARP Act in FY 2021 or FY 2022.  Section 9801
  of the ARP Act appropriated CCDF Mandatory funds to territories for the first time,
  including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
  Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Mandatory funds to territories
  are allotted based on the number of children under age five living in territories
  and per capita income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds are not subject
  to any matching requirements. Territory Mandatory funds must be obligated in the
  fiscal year that they are awarded and liquidated in the following year.\n\nNot less
  than 1%, but not more than 2% of the total Mandatory and Matching Funds are reserved
  for Tribes and tribal organizations based on the number of children living on or
  near Tribal reservations or other appropriate area served by the tribal recipient.
  Tribes and tribal organizations are not required to provide matching funds.  Prior
  to the ARP Act, Tribal lead agencies received a proportion of the child care funds
  appropriated under Section 418 of the Social Security Act.  Section 9801 of the
  ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) amended the Social Security Act to explicitly appropriate
  $100 million in Mandatory funds to Tribal lead agencies. This increases the initial
  FY 2021 Mandatory funds awarded to Tribal lead agencies by 70 percent. Otherwise,
  the requirements for Tribal Mandatory funds remain the same. Mandatory funds to
  Tribes are allocated based on the number of children under the age of 13 in a Tribe\u2019s
  service area. In addition to the block grants to States, Territories and Tribes,
  a small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical
  assistance to lead agencies on administering the program. A small portion of CCDF

  Health Research Grants","objective":"The mission of the National Institute of Mental
  Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses
  through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and
  cure.  \n\nIn May 2020, NIMH released its new Strategic Plan for Research.  The
  new Strategic Plan builds on the successes of previous NIMH strategic plans by providing
  a framework for scientific research and exploration, and addressing new challenges
  in mental health.\n\nThe new Strategic Plan outlines four high-level Goals: \n\u2022
  Goal 1: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex Behaviors\n\u2022 Goal 2:
  Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan\n\u2022 Goal 3: Strive for
  Prevention and Cures\n\u2022 Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health Impact of NIMH-Supported
  Research\n\nThese four Goals form a broad roadmap for the Institute\u2019s research
  priorities over the next five years, beginning with the fundamental science of the
  brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based services that improve public
  health outcomes. The Institute\u2019s overall funding strategy is to support a broad
  spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with increasing
  use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public health
  impact is a short-term measure of success.  \n\nThe new Strategic Plan also addresses
  a number of cross-cutting themes that are relevant to all research supported by
  NIMH; these themes highlight areas where NIMH-funded science may have the greatest
  impact, bridge gaps, and offer novel approaches to accelerate advances in mental
  health research. For example, NIMH values a comprehensive research agenda that takes
  an inclusive approach that ensures research interests are varied, maintain diverse
  participation and partnerships, and achieve research goals across multiple timeframes.
  This includes diverse methodologies, tools, and models; research addressing complex
  basic, translational, and applied questions; research including both sexes and,
  as appropriate, genetic background; and, participants from diverse racial and ethnic
  backgrounds, and across gender identities, geographical context, socioeconomic status,
  neurotype, and age \u2013 offering the best possible representation, for the broadest
  number of individuals who may ultimately benefit from these scientific advances.\n\nTo
  accomplish the Goals outlined in the new Strategic Plan, NIMH will support research
  that aims:\n\nTo characterize the genomic, molecular, cellular, and circuit components
  contributing to brain organization and function; to identify the developmental,
  functional, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to cognitive, affective, and social
  domains, across units of analysis; and, to generate and validate novel tools, techniques,
  and measures to quantify changes in the activity of molecules, cells, circuits,
  and connectomes. \n\nTo discover gene variants and other genomic elements that contribute
  to the development of mental illnesses in diverse populations; to advance our understanding
  of the complex etiology of mental illnesses using molecular epidemiologic approaches
  that incorporate individual genetic information in large cohorts; to elucidate how
  human genetic variation affects the coordination of molecular, cellular, and physiological
  networks supporting higher-order functions and emergent properties of neurobiological
  systems; and, to develop novel tools and techniques for the analysis of large-scale
  genetic, multi-omic data as it applies to mental health. \n\nTo utilize connectomic
  approaches to identify brain networks and circuit components that contribute to
  various aspects of mental function and dysfunction; to determine through brain-wide
  analysis how changes in the physiological properties of molecules, cells, and circuits
  contribute to mental illnesses; to develop molecular, cellular, and circuit-level
  biomarkers of impaired neural function in humans; and, to develop innovative technologies,
  \u2013 including new imaging, computational, pharmacological, and genetic tools
  \u2013 to interrogate and modulate circuit activity and structure altered in mental
  illnesses. \n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the trajectories of brain
  development and behavior; and, to characterize the emergence and progression of
  mental illnesses, and identifying sensitive periods for optimal intervention. \n\nTo
  determine early risk and protective factors, and related mechanisms, to serve as
  novel intervention groups; and, to develop reliable and robust biomarkers and assessment
  tools to predict illness onset, course, and across diverse populations. \n\nTo develop
  novel interventions using a mechanism-informed, experimental therapeutics approach;
  and, to develop and implement measurement strategies to facilitate mechanism-based
  intervention development and testing. \n\nTo investigate personalized intervention
  strategies across disease progression and development; and, to develop and refine
  computational approaches and research designs that can be used to inform and test
  personalized interventions. \n\nTo develop and test approaches for adapting, combining,
  and sequencing interventions to achieve the greatest impact on the lives and functioning
  of persons seeking care; to conduct efficient pragmatic trials that employ new tools
  to rapidly identify, engage, assess, and follow participants in the context of routine
  care; and, to enhance the practical relevance of effectiveness research via deployment-focused,
  hybrid, effectiveness-implementation studies. \n\nTo employ assessment platforms
  within healthcare systems to accurately assess the distribution and determinants
  of mental illnesses and to inform strategies for improved services; to optimize
  real-world data collection systems to identify strategies for improving access,
  quality, effectiveness, and continuity of mental health services; and, to compare
  alternative financing models to promote effective and efficient care for individuals
  with serious emotional disturbances and serious mental illnesses. \n\nTo strengthen
  partnerships with key stakeholders to develop and validate strategies for implementing,
  sustaining, and continuously improve evidence-based practices; to build models to
  scale-up evidence-based practices for use in public and private primary care, specialty
  care and other settings; and, to develop decision-support tools and technologies
  that increase the effectiveness and continuous improvement of mental health interventions
  in public and private primary care, specialty care, and other settings. \n\nTo adapt,
  validate, and scale-up programs currently in use that improve mental health services
  for underserved populations; to develop and validate service delivery models that
  provide evidence-based care for individuals throughout the course of mental illness;
  to develop and validate systems-level strategies using technology and other approaches,
  to identify, support, and monitor the effectiveness of evidence-based care throughout
  the course of illness; and, to develop and validate decision-making models that
  bridge mental health, medical, and other care settings to integrate the appropriate
  care for people with serious mental illnesses and comorbid medical conditions.","permalink":"/program/93.242","agency":"Department

  (FMA) grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, Federally
  Recognized Tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the
  risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National
  Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It does so with a recognition of the growing flood
  hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation
  activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect
  to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors
  which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency
  in the future. From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion
  in federal share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood
  Insurance Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance indicators
  provide strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about
  FMA\u2019s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based
  on measurable data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n\u2022\tTotal

  amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA subapplications.\nFEMA
  will further assess the recipient\u2019s performance against the program objective
  during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding opportunity.
  \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through
  pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective
  5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the
  FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize
  investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding
  the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood mitigation projects. The
  FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure
  Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy
  and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment
  to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation\u2019s resilience
  to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part,
  with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more
  commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation
  investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and
  equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality
  jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged
  communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient
  infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with
  the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement
  projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured
  under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds
  in line with the Administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive
  Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made
  it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy,
  and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and
  overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative,
  the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities
  as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from congressionally
  appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding
  made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property:

  5-Year Program and/or the Section 811 Voucher Program) were originally authorized

  Vouchers provides tenant-based assistance to persons with disabilities. Until the
  passage of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374)
  (Melville Act), the program operated as a separate program distinct from the regular
  tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville Act converted the Mainstream
  5-Year Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program under 8(o) of the U.S.
  Housing Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except for serving a specific population,
  Mainstream vouchers are to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance. In
  other words, the same regulations at 24 CFR Part 982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance:
  Housing Choice Voucher Program) apply to Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority
  to treat families that receive a Mainstream voucher differently from other applicants
  and participants of the HCV program. After enactment of the Melville Act (i.e.,
  subsequent to conversion of this assistance to section 8(o) voucher assistance),
  funding for Mainstream voucher renewals and administrative fees was first provided
  in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55)
  under its own paragraph under the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading.
  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided funding for incremental Mainstream
  vouchers for the first time since the enactment of the Melville Act (in addition
  to renewal and administrative fee funding). These incremental vouchers exclusively
  assisted non-elderly persons with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations
  Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (\"2019 Act\") also provided
  funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities,
  in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act
  states that all new and existing Mainstream vouchers must be provided to non-elderly
  persons with disabilities upon turnover. Consistent with prior appropriations acts,
  all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream vouchers was provided under its own paragraph
  (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA heading in the 2019 Act). While the Melville
  Act requires Mainstream vouchers to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance,
  the separate HCV Mainstream appropriations results in an accounting of Mainstream

  costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue
  transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2025 with services being provided
  and eligible for MFP-enhanced match through December 31, 2026. All claiming of services
  must be finalized by September 30, 2027. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts
  to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of
  where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use
  of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based
  services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets
  that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the
  settings of their choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide
  HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures
  in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration
  provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months
  for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from
  an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for
  transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than
  60 consecutive days. The State must continue to provide community-based services
  after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and
  is Medicaid eligible. Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of
  Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration
  period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must
  be conducted in conjunction with a \"qualified HCBS program\" which is a program
  that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner
  that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program
  for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will
  provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition.

  Extension Service","objective":"GENERAL: The Cooperative Extension Service (CES)
  has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education.
  The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to
  assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from
  disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families
  and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their
  resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded
  in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure,
  severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or
  high consequence animal diseases and plant pests. There has been an increase in
  public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents
  involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease,
  and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment
  and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National
  Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the
  Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response
  and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served
  as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities,
  and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses
  and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach
  includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing
  relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities
  to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery.
  Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005
  and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents,
  local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected
  urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were
  temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages
  proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target
  areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state
  disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially
  those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN
  and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation,
  response and recovery; 2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and
  other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities
  that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based
  activities; 3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that
  will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for,
  during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted
  regions; 4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users\u2019
  needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication
  channels due to disaster situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based
  information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is
  compromised; and 6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000)
  are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for
  the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel
  would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and
  lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects.
  Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce
  risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving
  communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies;
  2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of
  emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3. Develop
  community networks that provide real-time disaster education information;","permalink":"/program/10.500","agency":"Department

  participation of obstetricians and pediatricians; integrated service delivery systems;
  maternal and child health centers; services for rural populations; and integrated
  state and community service systems for children and youth with special health care
  needs.  \n \nThe Heritable Disorders Program serves to improve the ability of States
  1) to provide newborn and child screening for heritable disorders and 2) to expand
  screenings as the capacity to screen for genetic and congenital conditions expands.
  Newborn and child screenings occur at intervals across the life span of every child.
  Newborn screening universally provides early identification and follow-up for treatment
  of infants affected by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal and/or functional conditions.
  \n \nThe Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Screening and Intervention
  program trains primary care providers to reduce the incidence of prenatal alcohol
  exposure and improve developmental outcomes in children with suspected or diagnosed
  FASDs. The program reaches providers in states, territories, tribes, or communities
  that have high rates of binge drinking among pregnant women, especially in rural
  areas. \n\nThe Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance
  Use Disorders (MMHSUD)  program helps address maternal mental health conditions
  that affect women during and after pregnancy by expanding health care providers\u2019
  capacity to screen, assess, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum people for
  maternal depression and related behavioral disorders.\n \nThe Pediatric Mental Health
  Care Access (PMHCA) program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric
  primary care by developing new or expanding existing statewide or regional pediatric
  mental health care telehealth access programs that help these and other providers
  diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions. PMHCA works
  to address the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians,
  and other behavioral health clinicians to support children and adolescents with
  behavioral concerns.  \n\nThe Integrated Maternal Health Services program fosters
  the development and demonstration of integrated maternal health services models,
  such as the Maternity Medical Home, which is modeled after the patient-centered
  medical home. The models developed and demonstrated support comprehensive care for
  pregnant and postpartum people who experience health disparities and have limited
  access to basic social and health care services. \n\nThe Alliance for Innovation
  on Maternal Health (AIM) program promotes safety and quality of care during and
  immediately after childbirth and addresses the high rates of maternal morbidity
  and mortality in the U.S. It is the national, cross-sector commitment designed to
  lead in the identification, development, implementation, and dissemination of maternal
  (patient) safety bundles for the promotion of safe care for every U.S. birth. The
  AIM Technical Assistance Center supports all entities participating in the AIM program
  to increase birthing facility engagement, support bundle implementation and sustainability,
  manage reporting and analysis of state AIM data, and promote safe care for pregnant

  Research","objective":"Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means
  addressing people\u2019s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the whole
  life course. Science supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)
  uses this holistic perspective to improve individual and population health and advance
  health equity. NINR-supported research promotes health and well-being by addressing
  needs at multiple levels \u2013 individual, family, community, and societal levels
  \u2013 and developing treatment and prevention strategies that are responsive to
  the reality of people\u2019s lives. Nurses know people, and people trust nurses.
  Patient and families interact with nurses more than any other clinicians.  Nursing
  science uses this special relationship to better understand patients, families,
  and communities and the many factors that influence their health. Nursing science
  supported by NINR uses this knowledge to develop strategies for improving health
  and wellness across populations, health care settings, and the lifespan, with an
  emphasis on achieving health equity. NINR-supported scientists have developed interventions
  for:  supporting parents of premature infants; promoting HIV prevention in underserved
  populations; improving transitional care leading to better outcomes and cost-savings;
  and helping inner-city children manage asthma. Nursing science transcends the boundaries
  of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals
  and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize
  health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations
  and settings. NINR-supported science uses nursing science\u2019s unique, patient
  and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical and community settings
  to advance our understanding of the social determinants of health: those factors
  that are at the root of the inequities that we see, such as food insecurity and
  access to healthcare. NINR research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological,
  behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors
  and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the
  lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally
  appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and
  underserved groups. NINR also supports science to assist individuals, families,
  and health care professionals in managing advanced, serious illness, and planning
  for end-of-life decisions. In addition, NINR promotes technological advancements
  that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time
  personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and
  communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing
  the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who
  will carry the field of nursing science into the future. In order to prepare an
  innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports
  a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels,
  particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the

  and Training in Complementary and Integrative Health","objective":"To evaluate  complementary
  and integrative health approaches.  The following objectives support this goal:  (1)
  coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary and integrative health
  approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH
  National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the
  purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to
  be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a
  comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of
  Medicine.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)
  regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities,
  NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the
  recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative
  Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers,
  and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous
  evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range
  of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical
  investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability
  to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship
  to use and practice.\n\nResearch Approaches\nBasic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness,
  and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches
  need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize
  basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this research
  is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as
  their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH
  also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these
  approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific
  clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled
  conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need
  to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design
  and implement definitive clinical research and \"real world\" outcomes and effectiveness
  research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are
  in widespread public use.\n\nNCCIH\u2019s support of translational research addresses
  the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and
  innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within
  clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes
  studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop
  and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate
  treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity;
  assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical
  evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish
  feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future
  studies.\n\nNCCIH''s clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control,
  observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine
  safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches. The clinical
  research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved
  health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced
  in \"real-world\" settings.\nIn general, phase III clinical trials will be supported
  under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff.
  Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged
  to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers).\n\nAreas
  of Special Interest\nFundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress
  of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding
  serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved
  approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms.
  One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action
  of natural products, including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to
  sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex
  mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support
  research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota
  naturally present in the human body. \n\nAnother key goal is to advance our understanding
  of the mechanisms of action by which mind and body approaches (including, but not
  limited to: meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and
  acupuncture) affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   \n\nA third key goal is
  to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies
  of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These
  new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development
  of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management
  and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for
  hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body
  practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established
  methodology. \nNCCIH will also support studies in \"real world\" clinical settings
  to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their
  integration into health care. \n\nIndividual behavior plays a key role in health
  promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining
  healthy behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces
  risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of
  complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices
  that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across
  the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities
  to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in
  nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  \n\nTop
  Scientific Priorities\nThe top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic
  management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches
  for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and
  health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study
  designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health
  care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use
  complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that
  some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering
  the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in
  the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond.
  Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the
  structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains
  understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and
  neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative
  and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose
  of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products
  is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products
  broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing
  interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental,
  emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and
  physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of
  complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest.
  Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine
  the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion
  and disease prevention across the lifespan.\n\nEarly Stage and New Investigators\nNCCIH
  is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing
  a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing
  their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New
  investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g.,
  R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds,
  NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria
  for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may
  make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles
  or scores out of  payline order.\n\nNCCIH continues to accept applications in areas
  not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities.
  All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with the relevant

  for implementation and enforcement of the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water
  Act that apply to public water systems. In cases where a State or a Tribe does not
  have a Primary Enforcement Responsibility program, EPA is authorized to use funds
  that would have otherwise been made available to the State or the Tribe to assist
  it in direct implementation of the PWSS program. The fundamental goal of the PWSS
  Program, and the grants, is to ensure that public water systems comply with the
  National Primary Drinking Water Regulations listed in 40 CFR 141. State drinking
  water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the PWSS Program,
  and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are to use them to ensure that public
  drinking water systems, of all types, and of all sizes: (1) are currently in compliance
  with the drinking water regulations and remain in compliance, (2) are working towards
  and in the process of achieving compliance when these systems are noncompliant,
  and (3) are preparing for future compliance with any new drinking water regulations
  that will be taking effect in the current or following year. Furthermore, State
  drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the PWSS
  Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are required to use the funds
  to update and maintain its PWSS program to comply with the National Primary Drinking
  Water Regulations Implementation requirements listed in 40 CFR 142 to ensure that
  the State or Tribal PWSS program is capable of conducting oversight of all public
  water systems as new drinking water rules, new public water systems, and/or drinking
  water program requirements become effective.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  The
  priority for the PWSS grants is to ensure that the population served by community
  water systems will receive drinking water that meets all applicable health-based
  drinking water standards. This includes ensuring public water systems implement
  and comply with all drinking water rules, including carefully considering any simultaneous
  compliance issues. Furthermore, EPA''s priority is for States and Tribal PWSS Programs
  to meet the primary enforcement responsibilities. The primary components of a State
  or Tribal PWSS program are: (1) the adoption and implementation of State and Indian
  Tribe drinking water regulations at least as stringent as the Federal regulations;
  (2) the development and maintenance of database(s) of an inventory of public water
  systems and housing of public water system compliance information; (3) the conduct
  of sanitary surveys, which identifies sanitary deficiencies and requires that these
  deficiencies to be addressed, at public water systems; (4) the establishment and

  importance of recovery plans as a central organizing tool for guiding the recovery
  process by requiring their development for every listed species.\n\nHCP Land Acquisition
  Grants: Established by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 1997, the HCP Land Acquisition
  Grant program was designed to reduce conflicts between the conservation of listed
  species and competing land uses on specific parcels of land associated with approved
  and permitted HCPs. Under this program, the Service provides matching grants to
  States in support of land acquisition projects that will conserve species habitat
  in perpetuity through fee simple acquisition or the acquisition of permanent conservation
  easements. All land acquired through these grants complements, but does not replace,
  the mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring commitments of the HCP. Thus, this
  work is additive to the conservation commitments entered into when HCPs are permitted
  and serves as a meaningful way to leverage non-Federal investment in species recovery
  and connect conservation lands across the landscape.","permalink":"/program/15.615","agency":"Department

  lack of economic opportunities, with poor health outcomes and increased mortality
  rates, all of which are preventable. Factors such as poverty, inadequate housing,
  poor health care, and other debilitating social conditions, commonly referred to
  as social determinants of health, contribute to long-standing disparities and health
  inequities.\nThese social conditions contribute to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular
  disease (CVD) in the US population. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US;
  stroke is the 5th leading cause.  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults who died from CVD
  were younger than 65 years old. It is estimated that 1 in 9 health care dollars
  are spent on CVD.   \nCVD mortality rates declined for several decades due to both
  clinical and public health interventions, but recently declining death rates from
  both heart disease and stroke have stalled. One reason is that hypertension, the
  primary risk factor for CVD, is very common (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension)
  but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.\nGains
  have been made in treating high cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD.
  Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10%
  from 1988\u20131994 to 2017\u20132018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals\u2019
  healthy behaviors such as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically
  active, and medication adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate
  prescribing and intensification of medication. Additional public health and health
  system interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol
  and blood pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. \nThis program aims
  to implement and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention
  and management of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance
  of health equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities
  and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities to

  without the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The Department of Energy\u2019s
  National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has implemented this by competitively
  awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and providing
  funds to the DOE National Laboratories to support development of non-HEU Mo-99 production
  technologies. Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct technetium-99m
  (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures performed
  daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart disease and
  cancer, as well as studying organ structure and function. The isotope\u2019s short

  Homeland Security","objective":"DHS S&T seeks to establish a university-led consortium
  that work closely with DHS Components and their partners to conduct research, develop
  and transition mission-relevant science and technology and educate the next generation
  of homeland security technical and scientific challenges identified by DHS components.
  To accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following Centers of Excellence
  (COEs) and associated objectives:\n\nThe Arctic Domain Awareness Center (ADAC) will
  focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition in maritime
  security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime environment
  issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology
  transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote
  maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced team of researchers
  is required to create an integrated array of research and education programs in
  the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis, and resilience research;
  2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology research.  DHS is interested
  in pursuing research that will address the needs and technological shortfalls that
  enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators to respond to catastrophic events.  Greater
  situational awareness in the Arctic maritime domain, including the Northern Bering
  Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement to prevent and respond to incidents of national
  significance.\n\nThe Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will
  conduct end-user focused research to enhance the application of analytic tools to
  enable the DHS components and offices to realize achievable improvements in operational
  efficiency, and to support real-time decision making to address homeland security-related
  threats and hazards. The research will provide technologies, education and training
  to improve data management and analysis, to facilitate operations research and systems
  analysis, to identify the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to
  critically assess risks to DHS missions and the people and property they protect.
  DHS expects this Center to develop the next generation of applied mathematical,
  computational, and statistical theory (including algorithms and methods), and to
  advance the quantitative analytical capabilities of DHS components and offices and
  their partners. This Center also will provide quantitative and analytical tools
  to administrators, investigators, field operators, and analysts across DHS components.\n\nThe
  Cross Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research
  and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations  that
  detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards
  that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s people, agriculture, and economy.  This
  Center\u2019s research will provide innovations and methods to improve biothreat
  screening and detection, prevention, and support response.  Researchers will seek
  to understand how advances in bioengineering can support the needs of operators
  in the field when confronted with emerging threats, both naturally occurring and
  in situations involving intentional exposures. The Center will also research how
  to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from diagnostics, genetics, sensors,
  and the environment. Today\u2019s analysts, first responders, professionals in public
  and animal health, and operators in the field are confronted with enormous amounts
  of data which, if understood, could assist in improving our ability to identify
  threats earlier and make decisions that save lives and the economy.\n\nThe Criminal
  Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center will provide solutions to enhance
  investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal
  networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation
  of the cyber domain. CINA will develop and conduct research and education programs
  that will help DHS and its partners enhance investigation strategies to counter
  the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities,
  and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. The Center
  will provide education and professional development to improve the cost-effectiveness
  of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction and prevention. CINA will also
  develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products, and technology-based solutions
  for agents, officers and investigators to better coordinate investigative strategies
  and operations to predict, avert and prosecute trans-national crimes. \n\nThe Critical
  Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) will conduct research and education that
  will enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to prepare and more rapidly recover from
  catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS and its partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary
  challenges that affect the Nation\u2019s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach,
  researchers will investigate multiple linked industrial sectors, utilities, and
  public services. These entities collectively prove critical to business continuity
  and community recovery within a specific metropolitan area. The place-based approach
  will allow CIRI to develop solutions to enhance preparedness and recovery of the
  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure systems. Critical infrastructures are the
  assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United
  States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect
  on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any
  combination thereof.\n\nThe Coastal Resilience Center (CRC) will conduct research
  and education to enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to safeguard people, infrastructure,
  and economies from catastrophic coastal natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes.
  The Coastal Resilience Center also will consider future climate trends and their
  impacts on coastal resilience. Areas of research will include coastal infrastructure
  resilience, building resilient communities, and disaster dynamics. The overarching
  goal of the Center will be to advance our understanding of coastal hazards to benefit
  a large number of public and private entities. DHS anticipates this research will
  produce tangible research and education results for use by DHS, other federal agencies,
  state and local governments, and other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering
  to Neutralize the Threat RealitY (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting
  transportation environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration
  across public and private entities, and producing new engineering approaches to
  securing crowded spaces with novel design concepts. There are growing threats from
  malicious threat actors that target unsecure spaces where they can inflict the gravest
  injury to human life and property. These threats result in physical, psychological,
  and financial losses on the individual, collective and societal level to the American
  population. To address these threats, DHS can make a difference by ensuring future
  public and private investment in urban infrastructure includes security principals.
  DHS seeks research that will ensure the Departments long-term needs are considered
  when infrastructure recapitalization occurs. SENTRY''s research will directly support
  the department\u2019s strategic framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence.
  The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional
  methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.\n\nThe Maritime
  Security Center (MSC) will continue ongoing research and education activities in
  coordination with U.S. Coast Guard and other customers to facilitate transition
  of appropriate projects to DHS components and advance integrated education efforts.
  MSC research projects focus on the following areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis,
  and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology
  Research; and Integration of Science and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance
  and Policy Research. In addition to pursuing key research and education initiatives
  based on DHS challenges, the Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge,
  technical skills, and leadership capabilities of the Nation\u2019s current and prospective
  maritime security workforce. At the core of the Center\u2019s mission is the transfer
  of its research and expertise into relevant, innovative educational programs. The
  Center\u2019s educational programs leverage the subject matter expertise and research
  assets of its academic partners and stakeholder network to provide multidisciplinary
  and experiential learning opportunities for students and tailored programs for professional
  audiences.\n\nThe National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education
  (NCITE) Center will conduct research and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities
  to support DHS operations that detect, assess, and respond to domestic terrorist
  activities that would harm the people and infrastructure of the United States. The
  Center\u2019s research portfolio will focus on four major theme areas: the nature
  of counterterrorism operations, development of the Nationwide Suspicious Activity
  Reporting Initiative, Terrorism Prevention, and Workforce Development. The Center
  will provide education and professional development to ensure that the current and
  future homeland security enterprise workforce is adequately trained and educated
  to prepare for and respond to terrorist activities.","permalink":"/program/97.061","agency":"Department

  Estuary Program","objective":"The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect
  and restore the water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated
  watersheds designated by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance.
  The 28 estuaries of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management
  approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each
  NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed,
  develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan
  (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners,
  including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs
  can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands;
  supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily
  Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics
  loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings
  and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source
  pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green infrastructure approaches;
  preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or managing their impacts;
  developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability
  assessments and developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies
  and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing
  strategies to provide opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served
  communities to have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem
  restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational activities. In addition
  to CCMP implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients, address urgent and challenging
  issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. NEP
  projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA,
  Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), should
  seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure that benefits reach
  disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities
  to climate change, and leverage additional resources, including from other IIJA
  programs. After approval of each estuary program\u2019s equity strategy, EPA will
  waive non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024 \u2013 FY 2026 IIJA funds.
  The purpose of the equity strategy is to ensure that each NEP is reviewing potential
  projects and utilization of IIJA funds through the lens of equitable and fair access
  to the benefits from environmental programs for all individuals. The equity strategy
  should outline how IIJA funds will be utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged
  communities and the benefits that flow to them.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year
  2023: EPA''s funding priority is to award assistance agreements that support the
  28 National Estuary Programs'' (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds''
  priority problems identified in each of the 28 long-term management plans known
  as Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused
  support for NEPs to address priority problems identified by NEP management conferences
  and to document accomplishments and environmental results. NEP efforts address such
  problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients,
  toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable
  to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings
  can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water
  bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate
  change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials''
  capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community
  resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments
  and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and
  4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land
  use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In FY 2023,
  EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary organization
  to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging issues

  care, and other debilitating social conditions are endemic to some communities,
  including Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Native American communities.  \nResearch
  highlights the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension,
  high cholesterol, and stroke in these groups. CVD is the leading cause of death
  in the US and stroke is the 5th leading cause with an estimated 1 in 9 health care
  dollars spent treating CVD. Despite significant decreases in CVD rates in the last
  20 years, NHB continue to have higher CVD mortality rates than Non-Hispanic Whites
  (NHW). In 2019, NHB women and men younger than 65 were 2.0 and 1.3 times more likely
  to experience premature death from CVD than their NHW counterparts. In 2020, NHB
  had the highest heart disease mortality rates at 228.6 per 100,000 and stroke at
  56.8 per 100,000.  \nUncontrolled hypertension is the primary contributor to morbidity
  and mortality rate disparities in CVD between NHB and other racial and ethnic groups.
  In 2019, NHB had more than double the age-adjusted death rates (56.7) attributable
  primarily to hypertension compared to NHW (25.7). \nOf the 1 in 2 US adults with

  blood pressure. Among NHB adults who did not report a hypertension diagnosis, a
  larger proportion (28%) were unaware of hypertension (BP \u2265140/90 mm Hg) compared
  to NHW adults (16%). Despite the similar rate of hypertension treatment, only one-third
  of NHB adults had their blood pressure controlled, in contrast to 45.0% of NHW adults.
  These data clearly indicate that NHB bear the greatest burden of CVD among US adults.  \nThe
  outcomes are as stark in other CVD-related illnesses. Although the prevalence of
  high cholesterol in NHB is comparable to or lower than in NHW, racial-ethnic disparities
  occur at every level of diagnosis and management. The disparities present in low
  screening rates, fewer prescriptions, and medication adherence. Unsatisfactory control
  of high cholesterol among NHB stems from the same adverse social conditions that
  hinder the control of hypertension. \nInterventions must include an understanding
  of individual and community factors that influence a healthy diet, losing weight,
  being physically active, and medication adherence to address the disparities and
  inequities. There is a need for equity-focused health system interventions to prevent,
  detect, control, and manage hypertension and high cholesterol. Building on lessons
  from the previous work, this program focuses on comprehensive efforts to identify
  and respond to health care disparities and improve CVD-related outcomes, specifically
  for those with hypertension and high cholesterol. \nPopulations of focus for this
  program are adults aged 18 and older with a hypertension crude prevalence of 53%
  or higher, as shown by data specifically at the census tract level.  Emphasis should
  be placed on achieving impact and reach across geographic locations where disparate
  populations can benefit from the strategies included in this program.","permalink":"/program/93.435","agency":"Department

  with behavioral components.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP)
  Program\u2019s objectives are to reduce the prevalence of suicide and substance
  use and decrease the overall use of addicting and illicit substances among AI/AN
  populations, by improving care coordination; expanding behavioral health care services
  through the use of culturally appropriate evidence-based and practice-based models
  to address these issues; develop or expand on activities for the Generation Indigenous
  Initiative (Gen-I) by implementing early intervention strategies for AI/AN youth
  at risk for suicidal behavior.\n\nThe objective of the Behavioral Health Integration
  Initiative (BH2I) program is to improve the physical and mental health status of
  people with behavioral health issues by developing an integrative, coordinated system
  of care.  Awardees of this program will increase capacity among Tribal and Urban
  Indian organization (UIO) health facilities to implement an integrative approach
  in the delivery of behavioral health services, including trauma-informed care, nutrition,
  exercise, social, spiritual, cultural, and primary care services to improve morbidity
  and mortality outcomes among the AI/AN population.  In addition, this effort will
  support activities that address improving the quality of life for individuals suffering
  from mental illness, substance use disorders, and adverse childhood experiences.\n\nThe
  objective of the Community Overdose Intervention Prevention Program is to address
  the opioid crisis in AI/AN communities by the following three things: first, developing
  and expanding community education and awareness of prevention, treatment and recovery
  activities for opioid misuse and opioid use disorder; second, increase knowledge
  and use of culturally appropriate interventions and to encourage an increased use

  National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries
  that will assure protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation
  of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows
  recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program''s
  approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda,
  has a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound Estuary''s environment by meeting
  2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course
  to recovery of our nation''s largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates
  the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies
  and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions
  provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to
  better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting
  and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development
  in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and
  waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide
  and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic,
  nutrient and pathogen pollution. This program has the following main objectives:
  First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget Sound, is the
  primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest priority work
  as articulated in every four-year updates to the Action Agenda work plan. The updated
  work plan identifies implementation strategies to achieve reductions in the harmful
  impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem functions.
  A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Science Work Plan
  which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed in order
  for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is to support
  implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical studies
  and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities and
  help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation activities.
  Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental outcomes,
  the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management of the
  program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of Puget Sound.
  The program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and
  objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities
  in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
  Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure
  goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient
  and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year 2021-2026 : Funding will be continued for the three strategic initiative leads
  (SILs) which will  focus on: Award and manage subawards to support the implementation
  of the Action Agenda with a focus on Implementation Strategies; maintain Strategic
  Initiative Advisory Teams (SIATs) to advise in investment-related decision-making;

  basis to private, nonprofit organizations that are community development corporations
  (CDCs). The CDC provides technical and financial assistance for economic development
  activities that address the economic needs of individuals and families with low
  income, through the creation of sustainable business development and employment
  opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial developments and equity investments
  or loans to capitalize a new business or expand an existing business, so the businesses
  can create new, full-time permanent jobs for individuals with low incomes. CED allows
  communities to drive the type of investment and/or business to that which is most
  needed in the community. Seventy-five percent of the jobs created must be filled
  by individuals that are below 200% of HHS poverty guideline. In addition to the
  CED Projects Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), CED has published three additional
  NOFOs that support communities with low-income that create business and job opportunities:
  (1) CED Focus on Social Enterprise (CED-SE); (2) CED Focus on Energy Communities
  (CED-Energy); and (3) CED Planning Grant (CED-Planning). All the initiatives have
  the same objectives of the CED program: to create economic mobility opportunities

  related to release prevention. A main cause of releases is the lack of proper operation
  and maintenance of UST systems, which is why the EPA published revised UST regulations
  in FY 2015 that address these and other important issues. These changes will require
  subsequent state adoption, applicable updates to state regulations, and updates
  to state program approval. For tribes, the LUST prevention assistance agreements
  will assist with all aspects of the tribal programs, e.g., inspection capacity.
  High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to tribes for: 1) inspecting
  UST facilities to complete the three-year inspection requirement; 2) developing

  Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS) Cooperative Agreement
  Program provides funding to support community-based organizations in their efforts
  to collaborate and partner with local stakeholder groups (e.g., local businesses
  and industry, local government, medical service providers, and academia) as they
  develop and implement solutions that address environmental and/or public health
  issues for underserved communities. For purposes of this listing, the term \u201cunderserved
  community\u201d refers to a community with environmental justice concerns and/or
  vulnerable populations, including people of color, low income, rural, tribal, indigenous,
  and homeless populations. Eligible projects must demonstrate use of the Environmental
  Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Model to support their collaborative efforts
  during the project period. Applying organizations should have a direct connection
  to the underserved community impacted by the environmental harms and risks detailed
  in the workplan. The long-term goals of the EJCPS Program are to help build the
  capacity of communities with environmental justice concerns and to create self-sustaining,
  community-based partnerships that will continue to improve local environments in
  the future.\n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: For the 2023 competition,
  EPA may give special consideration to high-ranking applications that focus on the
  following program priorities: 1) Rural Areas \u2013 EPA may give special consideration
  to high-ranking proposals to be performed in rural areas as defined by the program.
  Rural areas, for the purposes of this competition, are defined as local areas with
  populations of 50,000 or less that have limited access to public or private resources
  commonly found in metropolitan areas. Applicants claiming rural status must provide
  sufficient detail (census data, population figures, descriptions of local resources,
  etc.) for EPA to validate the rural status of the underserved community. The goal
  of this special consideration is to encourage and increase project performance in
  rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants program. 2) Health Impact Assessments (HIA) \u2013
  HIA is a tool designed to investigate how a proposed program, project, policy, or
  plan may impact health and well-being and inform decision-makers of these potential
  outcomes before the decision is made. EPA may give special consideration to HIA
  projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on
  the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those
  effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing Climate, Disaster Resiliency,
  and/or Emergency Preparedness \u2013 The effects of climate change and extreme weather
  events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations
  disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration to projects that
  address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that have been adversely
  impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters, including,
  but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and future
  pandemics.","permalink":"/program/66.306","agency":"Environmental Protection Agency","obligations":6719004.0},{"cfda":"16.757","title":"Judicial

  crops, were participating in a disaster program for the first time.\n\nMany producers
  are not aware that receiving funds from USDA through activities such as an EQIP

  a tax liability for their farm business. Often producers who receive financial support
  from USDA do not have the technical knowledge or understanding of how USDA program
  payments are treated for tax purposes or where to get support regarding tax questions.
  Taxpayer education has been a longstanding issue in the agricultural community.
  There is a dearth of preparers in rural areas, many producers are not knowledgeable
  about agricultural taxes, and producers do not have the knowledge or resources necessary
  to integrate tax planning into their farm financial planning process. USDA frequently
  works with historically underserved, beginning, and limited resource producers who

  that include, but is not limited to, such things as endangered and special status
  species recovery, grazing of domestic livestock, recreation, forest management,
  hazardous fuels reduction, and post fire rehabilitation. To better support land
  management decisions regarding grazing and other range management treatments, soils
  management, and invasive species, the BLM will place a priority on collecting data
  through the use of consistent, comparable, and common indicators, consistent methods,
  and an unbiased sampling framework which will allow for analyses that are repeatable
  and comparable across a region, and decisions based on science and data that are
  legally defensible. Land health assessments completed at a larger scale will be
  more efficient and less costly over time and provide timely support for decision-making.
  The Rangeland Management program conducts inventories, assessments and evaluations
  of soil and vegetation conditions and land health. Monitoring data is collected
  and analyzed to ensure progress toward meeting land health standards.  Funded projects
  under this program will focus on high priority work such as activities that support

  State Assistance grant program utilizes two separate funding opportunities: Individual
  State Earthquake Assistance (ISEA), and Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance
  (MSNEA). The Individual State Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity provides
  funding directly to those States and Territories that have been determined to be
  at a high, or a very high risk of earthquakes, and who can provide the statutory
  25 percent cost-share. They must also be able to demonstrate that the assistance
  will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State. Funding is provided to eligible
  States and Territories through non-competitive grants that are administered by FEMA

  must carry out activities within the terms of EPA''s statutory authorities. The
  statutes allow the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements that use technical
  assistance methods of: research, investigation, experiments, education, training,
  studies, and/or demonstration of innovative techniques to perform source reduction
  work. SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring
  information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this \"learning\" concept,
  as opposed to \"fixing\" an environmental problem using a well-established method.
  For projects that will support demonstration activity, the project must involve
  new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results of the
  project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained
  in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the performance
  of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended
  to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge,
  however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration. In addition, projects
  must demonstrate how source reduction approaches are new or experimental and how

  sectors, then an explanation must be provided in the applicant''s proposal noting
  how the demonstration project is different from such prior projects and is a true
  demonstration. The applicant must also explain what will be learned from the demonstration.

  the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. DITCAs are an increasingly important
  avenue for EPA and the tribes to realize meaningful environmental protection in
  Indian Country. DITCAs enable EPA to partner with tribes to help fulfill EPA''s
  direct implementation authorities, yield environmental results, and assist the Agency
  in meeting its Strategic Plan goals and targets. DITCAs also provide tribes with
  flexibility and opportunity by allowing tribes, through a workplan with EPA and
  under federal authority, to choose aspects of a program that address their tribal
  environmental needs and priorities, to determine the scope and pace of tribal involvement,
  and to build tribal capacity to implement environmental programs.\n\nEPA is committed
  to work on a government-to-government basis to build tribal capacity to implement
  federal programs through delegations, authorizations, and primacy designations to
  enable tribes to meaningfully participate in the Agency\u2019s policy making, standard
  setting, and direct implementation activities under federal environmental statutes.
  EPA will work with individual tribes to develop and implement an EPA-Tribal Environmental
  Plan (ETEP), a joint planning document for achieving stronger environmental and
  human health protection in Indian country. ETEPs identify tribal, EPA, and shared
  priorities, and the roles and responsibilities for addressing those priorities.
  EPA will focus its direct implementation efforts on areas of high need for human
  health or environmental protection, including programs identified in the ETEP for
  which tribes are not eligible, as well as those for which tribes do not currently
  anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. In carrying out its direct
  implementation activities, EPA will work closely with tribes to develop tribal capacity
  to meaningfully participate in programs for which they do not anticipate seeking
  delegation, authorization, or primacy. EPA will also encourage tribes to participate
  in policy making and to assume appropriate partial roles in the implementation of
  programs, including through the use of DITCAs or other agreements, as available.
  DITCAs provide an avenue for tribes and EPA to partner in implementing meaningful
  environmental protection programs in Indian country. Because DITCAs can address
  a wide range of activities, and the need for implementation of these activities
  in Indian country is great, the funding priority is for any eligible activity that

  Outreach Education and Technical Assistance","objective":"The Emergency Relief Program
  (ERP) is intended to help agricultural producers offset the impacts of natural disasters
  in 2020 and 2021. Congress included emergency funding in the Extending Government
  Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43). ERP\u2019s first
  round of disaster funding provided payments to producers using existing data and
  did not require outreach because producers were automatically enrolled in the program.
  The second phase of ERP is aimed at filling gaps and providing assistance to producers
  who did not participate in or receive payments through the existing risk management
  programs that were leveraged for phase 1 implementation. \n\nPhase 2 of ERP will
  provide assistance to producers who suffered losses due to qualifying natural disasters
  in 2020 and 2021. This program will be revenue based and will require participation
  in a risk management program for the next two crop years. These eligibility criteria
  and risk management linkage requirements create unique needs around outreach and
  technical assistance for this program. Producers will need to supply information
  to FSA that would typically be found on their Schedule F tax forms, and if they
  have not filed a Schedule F, be able to supply acceptable revenue records or create
  the required application data from their own farm records.  Producers will also
  need to identify and enroll in the appropriate risk management program for their
  operation.\n \nThe assistance ERP program participants will need in order to supply
  application information will be unique to their individual operation and tax situation,
  and more technical than the information we typically provide as part of general
  outreach and program education. As a result, the communication, technical support,
  and outreach strategies around ERP for producers need to be focused, targeted and
  technical in nature. This program also offers the opportunity to connect with producers
  who have not worked with their local FSA office, and an opportunity to not only
  participate in ERP but also serve as a gateway to risk management tools and other
  FSA and USDA programs and services. FSA has $8 million available for cooperative
  agreements to provide outreach and technical assistance for the Emergency Relief
  Program Phase 2. \n\nThe Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with stakeholder organizations
  to effectively reach producers, including those that are small, underserved, and
  not currently participating in existing programs who did not apply under phase 1
  of the ERP program.  FSA is seeking proposals from eligible entities that focus
  on outreach for increasing awareness about ERP and have the primary goal of connecting
  landowners interested in program participation to apply under a traditional FSA
  application process. \n\nExpeditated outreach by stakeholders should include:\n\u2022\tTechnical

  (RFA) is to make emerging technologies more accessible to small and mid-size processors
  through work with small business innovators that have demonstrated significant efficacy
  in development and advancements towards commercialization of relevant technology.
  Eligible meat and poultry processing channels include independent business owners,
  entrepreneurs, producers, and other groups, such as cooperatives and worker associations

  of PFAS is ongoing, but lab and epidemiological studies have found possible human
  health risks to PFAS exposure.\n\nThere is potential that agricultural lands and
  the commodities they produce can become contaminated through a variety of means,
  and there are many factors that influence if a particular property is impacted.
  These factors include the type and concentration of PFAS, climate, hydrogeology,
  geology, and environmental conditions. \n\nThis program will support the ongoing

  (also known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act). Enacted in 2020,
  the American Manufacturing and Innovation (AIM) Act authorizes EPA to address climate-damaging
  greenhouse gases called Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by: phasing down their production

  and facilitating the transition to next-generation technologies through sector-based
  restrictions on HFCs. For more information on the AIM Act and its implementing regulations,
  please visit https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction.  \n\nThe objectives of
  these grants are to support and contribute to addressing HFCs under the AIM Act
  by funding three project areas: (1) Reclaim Technologies - pilot projects or proofs
  of concept for new/better technologies to increase the reclamation of HFCs by expanding
  access to reclamation and improving the reclamation process; (2) Reclaim Market
  Dynamics - programs or pilot projects for innovative strategies that address market
  dynamics to increase HFC reclamation by lowering barriers; and (3) Innovative Destruction
  Technologies - pilot projects/proof of concept for innovative technologies or innovative
  deployment of technologies to destroy unusable and unwanted HFCs. \n\nSuccessful
  implementation of these funds by grantees will result in the advancement of improved
  technologies and/or deployment of technologies for HFC reclamation and destruction
  and identification of successful mechanisms to address barriers to HFC reclamation.  In
  addition, successful projects will thoughtfully engage with, provide benefits to,
  and mitigate any potential negative impacts to low income and disadvantaged communities
  in project design and implementation. Finally, any projects that propose to build
  fixed infrastructure will have to comply with the Build America Buy America Act
  requirements.\n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024:  EPA intends to fund projects

  (3) innovative destruction technologies. EPA\u2019s funding priorities are to make
  awards to applicants that can demonstrate the highest impact (pounds of HFCs recovered
  or destroyed, as appropriate) with the funding provided. EPA will prioritize projects
  that are leveraged with other sources of funding, to increase the impact of the
  grants and increase the amount of reclaimed or destroyed HFCs. EPA also will prioritize
