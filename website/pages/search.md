  encompasses several transportation programs: \n\n1) Federal-aid Highway Program:
  The purpose of the Federal-aid Highway Program is to assist the States in providing
  for construction, preservation, and improvement of highways and bridges on eligible
  Federal-Aid routes, (including the National Highway System (NHS) - an integrated,
  interconnected transportation system important to interstate commerce and travel),
  and for other special purpose programs and projects.  This program also provides
  for the construction and improvement of highways in the District of Columbia, Puerto
  Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and
  the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\n2) The Federal Lands Highway Program: The Federal Lands
  Transportation Program (FLTP) provides assistance to the Federal Land Management
  Agencies (FLMAs) for Federally-owned roads and trails. It provides transportation
  engineering services and funding for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation
  of the highways and bridges that are on or provide access to federally owned lands.
  The Federal Lands Highway organization also provides training, technology deployment,
  and engineering services to other customers. \n\n3) The Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs (IIJA) Act also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is a once-in-a-generation
  investment in our infrastructure that will help grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness,
  create good jobs, and build our safe, resilient, and equitable transportation future.  BIL
  provides the basis for FHWA programs and activities through September 30, 2026.  It
  makes an investment of $350 billion in highway programs. This includes the largest
  dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  New
  programs under the BIL focus on key infrastructure priorities including rehabilitating
  bridges in critical need of repair, reducing carbon emissions, increasing system
  resilience, removing barriers to connecting communities, and improving mobility
  and access to economic opportunity.  Many of the new programs include eligibility
  for local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Tribes, and other
  public authorities, allowing them to compete directly for funding.  BIL also continues
  to focus the program on safety and performance-based investment and on accelerating
  project delivery through expedited environmental review and elimination of duplicate
  processes.\n\n4) The Highway Infrastructure Programs in the Department of Transportation
  Appropriations Act, 2018, included two new discretionary programs:  Competitive
  Bridge Program and Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program.  The
  Competitive Bridge Program was appropriated $225 million to be used for highway
  bridge rehabilitation or replacement projects for States that have a population
  density of less than 100 individuals per square mile and that demonstrate cost savings
  by bundling multiple highway bridge projects.","popularName":"Federal-Aid Highway

  choice voucher program is the federal government''s major program for assisting
  very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe,
  and sanitary housing in the private market. Since housing assistance is provided
  on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their own housing,
  including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is free
  to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited
  to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program serves the most economically
  vulnerable families in the country, including families with disabilities, elderly
  families, formerly homeless veterans, and families with children, through federal
  assistance voucher payments in the provision of meeting their rental housing needs.
  HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with
  the former Section 8 Certificate program (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing
  Reform Act states that a purpose of the legislation is \"consolidating the voucher
  and certificate programs for rental assistance under Section 8 of the United States
  Housing Act of 1937 (the \"USHA\") into a single market-driven program that will
  assist in making tenant-based rental assistance more successful at helping low-income
  families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income
  families\". The HCVP is administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized
  under State law to operate housing programs within an area or jurisdiction. The
  PHAs receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
  (HUD) to administer the voucher program. The PHA accepts a family\u2019s application
  for rental assistance, selects the applicant family for admission, and issues the
  selected family a voucher confirming the family\u2019s eligibility for assistance.
  The family must then find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the family\u2019s
  needs and desires in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant
  Payment contracts with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord
  directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays
  the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized
  by the program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family
  may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.","popularName":""},{"cfda":"84.063","title":"Federal

  a safe and efficient national airports system to satisfy the needs of the aviation
  interests of the U.S., with considerations for economics, environmental issues,
  local proprietary rights, and safeguarding the public investment. As an important
  component of that mission, ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide
  through grants. These grants contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing

  Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement:
  In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including
  the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport
  infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements
  and airport inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept
  in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent,
  Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is
  ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent
  of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS).
  The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the
  capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are
  required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA
  Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form
  5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting
  on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects.
  With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within
  that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and
  grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of
  performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project
  completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number
  of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant
  funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with
  and is reported on in the FAA\u2019s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.","popularName":"AIP,

  National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and
  treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way
  for prevention, recovery, and cure.  \n\nIn May 2020, NIMH released its new Strategic
  Plan for Research.  The new Strategic Plan builds on the successes of previous NIMH
  strategic plans by providing a framework for scientific research and exploration,
  and addressing new challenges in mental health.\n\nThe new Strategic Plan outlines
  four high-level Goals: \n\u2022 Goal 1: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex
  Behaviors\n\u2022 Goal 2: Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan\n\u2022
  Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures\n\u2022 Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health
  Impact of NIMH-Supported Research\n\nThese four Goals form a broad roadmap for the
  Institute\u2019s research priorities over the next five years, beginning with the
  fundamental science of the brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based
  services that improve public health outcomes. The Institute\u2019s overall funding
  strategy is to support a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental
  science, with increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research
  where public health impact is a short-term measure of success.  \n\nThe new Strategic
  Plan also addresses a number of cross-cutting themes that are relevant to all research
  supported by NIMH; these themes highlight areas where NIMH-funded science may have
  the greatest impact, bridge gaps, and offer novel approaches to accelerate advances
  in mental health research. For example, NIMH values a comprehensive research agenda
  that takes an inclusive approach that ensures research interests are varied, maintain
  diverse participation and partnerships, and achieve research goals across multiple
  timeframes. This includes diverse methodologies, tools, and models; research addressing
  complex basic, translational, and applied questions; research including both sexes
  and, as appropriate, genetic background; and, participants from diverse racial and
  ethnic backgrounds, and across gender identities, geographical context, socioeconomic
  status, neurotype, and age \u2013 offering the best possible representation, for
  the broadest number of individuals who may ultimately benefit from these scientific
  advances.\n\nTo accomplish the Goals outlined in the new Strategic Plan, NIMH will
  support research that aims:\n\nTo characterize the genomic, molecular, cellular,
  and circuit components contributing to brain organization and function; to identify
  the developmental, functional, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to cognitive,
  affective, and social domains, across units of analysis; and, to generate and validate
  novel tools, techniques, and measures to quantify changes in the activity of molecules,
  cells, circuits, and connectomes. \n\nTo discover gene variants and other genomic
  elements that contribute to the development of mental illnesses in diverse populations;
  to advance our understanding of the complex etiology of mental illnesses using molecular
  epidemiologic approaches that incorporate individual genetic information in large
  cohorts; to elucidate how human genetic variation affects the coordination of molecular,
  cellular, and physiological networks supporting higher-order functions and emergent
  properties of neurobiological systems; and, to develop novel tools and techniques
  for the analysis of large-scale genetic, multi-omic data as it applies to mental
  health. \n\nTo utilize connectomic approaches to identify brain networks and circuit
  components that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction;
  to determine through brain-wide analysis how changes in the physiological properties
  of molecules, cells, and circuits contribute to mental illnesses; to develop molecular,
  cellular, and circuit-level biomarkers of impaired neural function in humans; and,
  to develop innovative technologies, \u2013 including new imaging, computational,
  pharmacological, and genetic tools \u2013 to interrogate and modulate circuit activity
  and structure altered in mental illnesses. \n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms contributing
  to the trajectories of brain development and behavior; and, to characterize the
  emergence and progression of mental illnesses, and identifying sensitive periods
  for optimal intervention. \n\nTo determine early risk and protective factors, and
  related mechanisms, to serve as novel intervention groups; and, to develop reliable
  and robust biomarkers and assessment tools to predict illness onset, course, and
  across diverse populations. \n\nTo develop novel interventions using a mechanism-informed,
  experimental therapeutics approach; and, to develop and implement measurement strategies
  to facilitate mechanism-based intervention development and testing. \n\nTo investigate
  personalized intervention strategies across disease progression and development;
  and, to develop and refine computational approaches and research designs that can
  be used to inform and test personalized interventions. \n\nTo develop and test approaches
  for adapting, combining, and sequencing interventions to achieve the greatest impact
  on the lives and functioning of persons seeking care; to conduct efficient pragmatic
  trials that employ new tools to rapidly identify, engage, assess, and follow participants
  in the context of routine care; and, to enhance the practical relevance of effectiveness
  research via deployment-focused, hybrid, effectiveness-implementation studies. \n\nTo
  employ assessment platforms within healthcare systems to accurately assess the distribution
  and determinants of mental illnesses and to inform strategies for improved services;
  to optimize real-world data collection systems to identify strategies for improving
  access, quality, effectiveness, and continuity of mental health services; and, to
  compare alternative financing models to promote effective and efficient care for
  individuals with serious emotional disturbances and serious mental illnesses. \n\nTo
  strengthen partnerships with key stakeholders to develop and validate strategies
  for implementing, sustaining, and continuously improve evidence-based practices;
  to build models to scale-up evidence-based practices for use in public and private
  primary care, specialty care and other settings; and, to develop decision-support
  tools and technologies that increase the effectiveness and continuous improvement
  of mental health interventions in public and private primary care, specialty care,
  and other settings. \n\nTo adapt, validate, and scale-up programs currently in use
  that improve mental health services for underserved populations; to develop and
  validate service delivery models that provide evidence-based care for individuals
  throughout the course of mental illness; to develop and validate systems-level strategies
  using technology and other approaches, to identify, support, and monitor the effectiveness
  of evidence-based care throughout the course of illness; and, to develop and validate

  Assistance (FMA) grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories,
  Federally Recognized Tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate
  the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the
  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It does so with a recognition of the growing
  flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk
  mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with
  respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic
  stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and
  frequency in the future. From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over
  $1.5 billion in federal share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National
  Flood Insurance Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance
  indicators provide strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders
  about FMA\u2019s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and
  are based on measurable data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n\u2022\tTotal

  will further assess the recipient\u2019s performance against the program objective
  during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding opportunity.
  \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through
  pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective
  5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the
  FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize
  investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding
  the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood mitigation projects. The
  FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure
  Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy
  and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment
  to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation\u2019s resilience
  to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part,
  with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more
  commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation
  investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and
  equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality
  jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged
  communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient
  infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with
  the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement
  projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured
  under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds
  in line with the Administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive
  Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made
  it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy,
  and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and
  overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative,
  the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities
  as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from congressionally
  appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding
  made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property:
  located within a census tract with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  Social Vulnerability Index score of not less than 0.5001. (Refer to Section C.4,

  Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) (Melville Act), the program operated as a separate program
  distinct from the regular tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville
  Act converted the Mainstream 5-Year Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV)
  Program under 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except
  for serving a specific population, Mainstream vouchers are to be treated the same
  as regular voucher assistance. In other words, the same regulations at 24 CFR Part
  982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program) apply to
  Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority to treat families that receive a Mainstream
  voucher differently from other applicants and participants of the HCV program. After
  enactment of the Melville Act (i.e., subsequent to conversion of this assistance
  to section 8(o) voucher assistance), funding for Mainstream voucher renewals and
  administrative fees was first provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing
  Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) under its own paragraph under the Tenant-Based
  Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided
  funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for the first time since the enactment
  of the Melville Act (in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding). These
  incremental vouchers exclusively assisted non-elderly persons with disabilities.
  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
  2019 (\"2019 Act\") also provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for
  non-elderly persons with disabilities, in addition to renewal and administrative
  fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act states that all new and existing Mainstream
  vouchers must be provided to non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover.
  Consistent with prior appropriations acts, all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream
  vouchers was provided under its own paragraph (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA
  heading in the 2019 Act). While the Melville Act requires Mainstream vouchers to

  Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), was designed to assist States to balance their long-term
  care systems and help Medicaid enrollees transition from institutions to the community.
  Congress initially authorized up to $1.75 billion in Federal funds through Fiscal
  Year (FFY) 2011. With the subsequent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable
  Care Act (P.L. 111-148) in 2010, section 2403 extended the program through September
  30, 2016. An additional $2.25 billion in Federal funds was appropriated through
  FFY 2016. Since then, section 2 of the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-3)
  added $112 million in Federal funds and changed the end date for the program from
  September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2021. Section 5 of the Medicaid Services Investment

  Act from $132 million to $254.5 million. Section 205 of the Further Consolidated
  Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) and section 3811 of the Coronavirus Aid,
  Relief, and Economic Security Act (P.L. 116-136) provided an additional $337.5 million.
  Section 2301 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act
  (P.L. 116-159) added $66.4 million, section 1107 of the Further Continuing Appropriations
  Act, 2021, and other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-215) added $6.5 million. Section 204
  of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) added $1.253 billion,
  extended and made changes to the program. Any funds remaining at the end of each
  fiscal year carry over to the next fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards
  to current grantees through FY 2023. Any unused grant funds awarded in FY 2023 can
  be used through FY 2027. No additional funding will be available after the final
  2023 awards are made; however, grantees will submit documentation to identify projected
  costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue
  transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2025 with services being provided
  and eligible for MFP-enhanced match through December 31, 2026. All claiming of services
  must be finalized by September 30, 2027. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts
  to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of
  where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use
  of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based
  services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets
  that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the
  settings of their choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide
  HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures
  in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration
  provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months
  for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from
  an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for
  transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than
  60 consecutive days. The State must continue to provide community-based services
  after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and
  is Medicaid eligible. Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of
  Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration
  period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must
  be conducted in conjunction with a \"qualified HCBS program\" which is a program
  that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner
  that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program
  for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will
  provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition.
  States will be required to participate in a national qualitative and quantitative
  evaluation conducted by CMS. Data collected on a national level will help evaluate
  the core objectives of the statute.","popularName":"(Money Follows the Person Demonstration)"},{"cfda":"20.813","title":"Maritime

  The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact
  of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors
  targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational
  response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this
  program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining
  by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards
  and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused
  by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters,
  security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant
  pests. There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity
  of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes,
  wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy
  of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee
  on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged
  the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played
  in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. Within the states and territories,
  the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped
  to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond
  to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred,
  the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based
  risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3)
  Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and
  4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than
  after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern
  Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served
  as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly
  when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed.
  The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one
  or more of the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance
  through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration
  projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing
  strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials
  related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration
  with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to
  support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural
  communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long range
  family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation
  of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency
  situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication
  delivery of key information that meets end-users\u2019 needs in a timely fashion
  with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster
  situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable
  and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated
  Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide
  assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly
  competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants
  (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and lead nationally important
  disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should
  support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce risk through planning,
  disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between
  the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 2. Develop strategies
  and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning,
  infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3. Develop community networks

  health and well-being means addressing people\u2019s needs in multiple settings,
  contexts, and over the whole life course. Science supported by the National Institute
  of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this holistic perspective to improve individual
  and population health and advance health equity. NINR-supported research promotes
  health and well-being by addressing needs at multiple levels \u2013 individual,
  family, community, and societal levels \u2013 and developing treatment and prevention
  strategies that are responsive to the reality of people\u2019s lives. Nurses know
  people, and people trust nurses. Patient and families interact with nurses more
  than any other clinicians.  Nursing science uses this special relationship to better
  understand patients, families, and communities and the many factors that influence
  their health. Nursing science supported by NINR uses this knowledge to develop strategies
  for improving health and wellness across populations, health care settings, and
  the lifespan, with an emphasis on achieving health equity. NINR-supported scientists
  have developed interventions for:  supporting parents of premature infants; promoting
  HIV prevention in underserved populations; improving transitional care leading to
  better outcomes and cost-savings; and helping inner-city children manage asthma.
  Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to
  better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness
  and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals
  at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR-supported science
  uses nursing science\u2019s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and
  wide reach across clinical and community settings to advance our understanding of
  the social determinants of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities
  that we see, such as food insecurity and access to healthcare. NINR research efforts
  in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that
  promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness
  across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also
  focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote
  health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR also supports
  science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing
  advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. In addition,
  NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges
  and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals
  and families, health care providers, and communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding
  and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists:
  those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into
  the future. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation

  purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to
  be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a
  comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of
  Medicine.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)
  regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities,
  NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the
  recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative
  Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers,
  and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous
  evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range
  of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical
  investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability
  to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship
  to use and practice.\n\nResearch Approaches\nBasic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness,
  and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches
  need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize
  basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this research
  is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as
  their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH
  also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these
  approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific
  clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled
  conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need
  to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design
  and implement definitive clinical research and \"real world\" outcomes and effectiveness
  research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are
  in widespread public use.\n\nNCCIH\u2019s support of translational research addresses
  the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and
  innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within
  clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes
  studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop
  and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate
  treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity;
  assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical
  evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish
  feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future
  studies.\n\nNCCIH''s clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control,
  observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine
  safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches. The clinical
  research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved
  health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced
  in \"real-world\" settings.\nIn general, phase III clinical trials will be supported
  under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff.
  Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged
  to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers).\n\nAreas
  of Special Interest\nFundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress
  of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding
  serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved
  approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms.
  One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action
  of natural products, including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to
  sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex
  mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support
  research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota
  naturally present in the human body. \n\nAnother key goal is to advance our understanding
  of the mechanisms of action by which mind and body approaches (including, but not
  limited to: meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and
  acupuncture) affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   \n\nA third key goal is
  to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies
  of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These
  new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development
  of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management
  and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for
  hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body
  practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established
  methodology. \nNCCIH will also support studies in \"real world\" clinical settings
  to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their
  integration into health care. \n\nIndividual behavior plays a key role in health
  promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining
  healthy behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces
  risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of
  complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices
  that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across
  the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities
  to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in
  nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  \n\nTop
  Scientific Priorities\nThe top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic
  management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches
  for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and
  health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study
  designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health
  care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use
  complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that
  some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering
  the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in
  the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond.
  Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the
  structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains
  understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and
  neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative
  and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose
  of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products
  is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products
  broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing
  interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental,
  emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and
  physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of
  complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest.
  Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine
  the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion
  and disease prevention across the lifespan.\n\nEarly Stage and New Investigators\nNCCIH
  is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing
  a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing
  their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New
  investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g.,
  R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds,
  NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria
  for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may
  make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles
  or scores out of  payline order.\n\nNCCIH continues to accept applications in areas
  not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities.
  All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with the relevant

  that would have otherwise been made available to the State or the Tribe to assist
  it in direct implementation of the PWSS program. The fundamental goal of the PWSS
  Program, and the grants, is to ensure that public water systems comply with the
  National Primary Drinking Water Regulations listed in 40 CFR 141. State drinking
  water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the PWSS Program,

  drinking water systems, of all types, and of all sizes: (1) are currently in compliance
  with the drinking water regulations and remain in compliance, (2) are working towards
  and in the process of achieving compliance when these systems are noncompliant,
  and (3) are preparing for future compliance with any new drinking water regulations
  that will be taking effect in the current or following year. Furthermore, State

  drinking water standards. This includes ensuring public water systems implement
  and comply with all drinking water rules, including carefully considering any simultaneous
  compliance issues. Furthermore, EPA''s priority is for States and Tribal PWSS Programs
  to meet the primary enforcement responsibilities. The primary components of a State
  or Tribal PWSS program are: (1) the adoption and implementation of State and Indian
  Tribe drinking water regulations at least as stringent as the Federal regulations;
  (2) the development and maintenance of database(s) of an inventory of public water
  systems and housing of public water system compliance information; (3) the conduct
  of sanitary surveys, which identifies sanitary deficiencies and requires that these
  deficiencies to be addressed, at public water systems; (4) the establishment and

  provides matching grants to States in support of land acquisition projects that
  will conserve species habitat in perpetuity through fee simple acquisition or the
  acquisition of permanent conservation easements. All land acquired through these
  grants complements, but does not replace, the mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring
  commitments of the HCP. Thus, this work is additive to the conservation commitments

  supports extensive scientific evidence, links nonmedical factors, including systemic
  racism and the lack of economic opportunities, with poor health outcomes and increased
  mortality rates, all of which are preventable. Factors such as poverty, inadequate
  housing, poor health care, and other debilitating social conditions, commonly referred
  to as social determinants of health, contribute to long-standing disparities and
  health inequities.\nThese social conditions contribute to the increased prevalence
  of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population. CVD is the leading cause of
  death in the US; stroke is the 5th leading cause.  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults
  who died from CVD were younger than 65 years old. It is estimated that 1 in 9 health
  care dollars are spent on CVD.   \nCVD mortality rates declined for several decades
  due to both clinical and public health interventions, but recently declining death
  rates from both heart disease and stroke have stalled. One reason is that hypertension,
  the primary risk factor for CVD, is very common (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension)
  but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.\nGains
  have been made in treating high cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD.
  Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10%
  from 1988\u20131994 to 2017\u20132018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals\u2019
  healthy behaviors such as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically
  active, and medication adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate
  prescribing and intensification of medication. Additional public health and health
  system interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol
  and blood pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. \nThis program aims
  to implement and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention
  and management of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance
  of health equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities
  and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities to

  from fleets operating in poor air quality areas and/or service goods movement facilities.
  Further, priority for funding may be given to projects which benefit and engage
  disadvantaged communities, and those which can demonstrate project sustainability,
  climate change adaptation and workforce development.  FY23 funding will be competed

  a university-led consortium that work closely with DHS Components and their partners
  to conduct research, develop and transition mission-relevant science and technology
  and educate the next generation of homeland security technical and scientific challenges
  identified by DHS components. To accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed
  the following Centers of Excellence (COEs) and associated objectives:\n\nThe Arctic
  Domain Awareness Center (ADAC) will focus on interdisciplinary research, education,
  and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme
  and remote maritime environment issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research,
  education, and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness,
  and extreme and remote maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced
  team of researchers is required to create an integrated array of research and education
  programs in the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis, and resilience
  research; 2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology research.  DHS
  is interested in pursuing research that will address the needs and technological
  shortfalls that enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators to respond to
  catastrophic events.  Greater situational awareness in the Arctic maritime domain,
  including the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement to prevent
  and respond to incidents of national significance.\n\nThe Center for Accelerating
  Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will conduct end-user focused research to enhance
  the application of analytic tools to enable the DHS components and offices to realize
  achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support real-time decision
  making to address homeland security-related threats and hazards. The research will
  provide technologies, education and training to improve data management and analysis,
  to facilitate operations research and systems analysis, to identify the economic
  impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically assess risks to DHS missions
  and the people and property they protect. DHS expects this Center to develop the
  next generation of applied mathematical, computational, and statistical theory (including
  algorithms and methods), and to advance the quantitative analytical capabilities
  of DHS components and offices and their partners. This Center also will provide
  quantitative and analytical tools to administrators, investigators, field operators,
  and analysts across DHS components.\n\nThe Cross Border Threat Screening and Supply
  Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research and develop solutions, protocols, and
  capabilities to support DHS operations  that detect, assess, and respond to known
  and unknown biological threats and hazards that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s
  people, agriculture, and economy.  This Center\u2019s research will provide innovations
  and methods to improve biothreat screening and detection, prevention, and support
  response.  Researchers will seek to understand how advances in bioengineering can
  support the needs of operators in the field when confronted with emerging threats,
  both naturally occurring and in situations involving intentional exposures. The
  Center will also research how to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from
  diagnostics, genetics, sensors, and the environment. Today\u2019s analysts, first
  responders, professionals in public and animal health, and operators in the field
  are confronted with enormous amounts of data which, if understood, could assist
  in improving our ability to identify threats earlier and make decisions that save
  lives and the economy.\n\nThe Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA)
  Center will provide solutions to enhance investigation strategies to counter the
  proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities,
  and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. CINA will develop
  and conduct research and education programs that will help DHS and its partners
  enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal
  networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation
  of the cyber domain. The Center will provide education and professional development
  to improve the cost-effectiveness of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction
  and prevention. CINA will also develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products,
  and technology-based solutions for agents, officers and investigators to better
  coordinate investigative strategies and operations to predict, avert and prosecute
  trans-national crimes. \n\nThe Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI)
  will conduct research and education that will enhance the Nation\u2019s ability
  to prepare and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS
  and its partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect the
  Nation\u2019s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach, researchers will investigate
  multiple linked industrial sectors, utilities, and public services. These entities
  collectively prove critical to business continuity and community recovery within
  a specific metropolitan area. The place-based approach will allow CIRI to develop
  solutions to enhance preparedness and recovery of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure
  systems. Critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether
  physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or
  destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,
  national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n\nThe Coastal Resilience
  Center (CRC) will conduct research and education to enhance the Nation\u2019s ability
  to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic coastal natural
  disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The Coastal Resilience Center also will
  consider future climate trends and their impacts on coastal resilience. Areas of
  research will include coastal infrastructure resilience, building resilient communities,
  and disaster dynamics. The overarching goal of the Center will be to advance our
  understanding of coastal hazards to benefit a large number of public and private
  entities. DHS anticipates this research will produce tangible research and education
  results for use by DHS, other federal agencies, state and local governments, and
  other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat RealitY
  (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting transportation environments and
  public venues, improving systems of collaboration across public and private entities,
  and producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded spaces with novel design
  concepts. There are growing threats from malicious threat actors that target unsecure
  spaces where they can inflict the gravest injury to human life and property. These
  threats result in physical, psychological, and financial losses on the individual,
  collective and societal level to the American population. To address these threats,
  DHS can make a difference by ensuring future public and private investment in urban
  infrastructure includes security principals. DHS seeks research that will ensure
  the Departments long-term needs are considered when infrastructure recapitalization
  occurs. SENTRY''s research will directly support the department\u2019s strategic
  framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence. The goal of SENTRY is to advance
  research that safeguards spaces where traditional methods to physical security are
  impractical to implement at scale.\n\nThe Maritime Security Center (MSC) will continue
  ongoing research and education activities in coordination with U.S. Coast Guard
  and other customers to facilitate transition of appropriate projects to DHS components
  and advance integrated education efforts. MSC research projects focus on the following
  areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis, and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain
  Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology Research; and Integration of Science
  and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance and Policy Research. In addition
  to pursuing key research and education initiatives based on DHS challenges, the
  Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge, technical skills, and leadership
  capabilities of the Nation\u2019s current and prospective maritime security workforce.
  At the core of the Center\u2019s mission is the transfer of its research and expertise
  into relevant, innovative educational programs. The Center\u2019s educational programs
  leverage the subject matter expertise and research assets of its academic partners
  and stakeholder network to provide multidisciplinary and experiential learning opportunities
  for students and tailored programs for professional audiences.\n\nThe National Counterterrorism
  Innovation, Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center will conduct research and develop
  solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations that detect, assess,
  and respond to domestic terrorist activities that would harm the people and infrastructure
  of the United States. The Center\u2019s research portfolio will focus on four major
  theme areas: the nature of counterterrorism operations, development of the Nationwide
  Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, Terrorism Prevention, and Workforce Development.
  The Center will provide education and professional development to ensure that the
  current and future homeland security enterprise workforce is adequately trained
  and educated to prepare for and respond to terrorist activities.","popularName":"(COE)"},{"cfda":"16.593","title":"Residential

  management approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For
  example, each NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding
  watershed, develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management
  Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners,
  including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs
  can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands;
  supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily
  Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics
  loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings
  and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source

  toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable
  to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings
  can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water
  bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate
  change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials''
  capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community
  resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments
  and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and
  4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land
  use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In FY 2023,

  purpose is referencing unequal socioeconomic conditions and unfair opportunity structures
  have long existed and contribute to poor health outcomes in minority and ethnic
  populations and geographically and economically disadvantaged communities. Poverty,
  inferior housing and health care, and other debilitating social conditions are endemic
  to some communities, including Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Native American
  communities.  \nResearch highlights the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease
  (CVD), including hypertension, high cholesterol, and stroke in these groups. CVD
  is the leading cause of death in the US and stroke is the 5th leading cause with
  an estimated 1 in 9 health care dollars spent treating CVD. Despite significant
  decreases in CVD rates in the last 20 years, NHB continue to have higher CVD mortality
  rates than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). In 2019, NHB women and men younger than 65
  were 2.0 and 1.3 times more likely to experience premature death from CVD than their
  NHW counterparts. In 2020, NHB had the highest heart disease mortality rates at
  228.6 per 100,000 and stroke at 56.8 per 100,000.  \nUncontrolled hypertension is
  the primary contributor to morbidity and mortality rate disparities in CVD between
  NHB and other racial and ethnic groups. In 2019, NHB had more than double the age-adjusted
  death rates (56.7) attributable primarily to hypertension compared to NHW (25.7).
  \nOf the 1 in 2 US adults with hypertension, only 26.1% have controlled blood pressure.
  By age 55, the cumulative incidence of hypertension reaches almost 76% in NHB men
  and women, compared to 54.5% and 40.0% among NHW men and women, respectively. Moreover,
  NHB had a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for hypertension after adjustment for other
  factors, regardless of baseline blood pressure. Among NHB adults who did not report
  a hypertension diagnosis, a larger proportion (28%) were unaware of hypertension
  (BP \u2265140/90 mm Hg) compared to NHW adults (16%). Despite the similar rate of
  hypertension treatment, only one-third of NHB adults had their blood pressure controlled,
  in contrast to 45.0% of NHW adults. These data clearly indicate that NHB bear the
  greatest burden of CVD among US adults.  \nThe outcomes are as stark in other CVD-related
  illnesses. Although the prevalence of high cholesterol in NHB is comparable to or
  lower than in NHW, racial-ethnic disparities occur at every level of diagnosis and
  management. The disparities present in low screening rates, fewer prescriptions,
  and medication adherence. Unsatisfactory control of high cholesterol among NHB stems
  from the same adverse social conditions that hinder the control of hypertension.
  \nInterventions must include an understanding of individual and community factors
  that influence a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication
  adherence to address the disparities and inequities. There is a need for equity-focused
  health system interventions to prevent, detect, control, and manage hypertension
  and high cholesterol. Building on lessons from the previous work, this program focuses
  on comprehensive efforts to identify and respond to health care disparities and
  improve CVD-related outcomes, specifically for those with hypertension and high
  cholesterol. \nPopulations of focus for this program are adults aged 18 and older
  with a hypertension crude prevalence of 53% or higher, as shown by data specifically
  at the census tract level.  Emphasis should be placed on achieving impact and reach
  across geographic locations where disparate populations can benefit from the strategies

  Act. The goal of the National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality
  in designated estuaries that will assure protection of public water supplies and
  the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish,
  fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget
  Sound National Estuary Program''s approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management
  Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda, has a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound
  Estuary''s environment by meeting 2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda
  for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation''s largest estuary\u2013it
  complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to
  describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound.
  These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal,
  and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA
  is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse
  impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include
  protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental
  watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the
  generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. This program has
  the following main objectives: First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action
  Agenda for Puget Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed
  to the highest priority work as articulated in every four-year updates to the Action
  Agenda work plan. The updated work plan identifies implementation strategies to
  achieve reductions in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously
  damaged aquatic ecosystem functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for
  Puget Sound is its Science Work Plan which identifies some of the core scientific
  work that must be completed in order for Action Agenda implementation efforts to
  succeed. This program is to support implementation of priority near term actions
  and to support the technical studies and investigations that are needed to help
  direct implementation priorities and help support the tracking systems and evaluation
  approaches for implementation activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement
  of specific environmental outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations
  inform adaptive management of the program significantly contributing to the restoration
  and protection of Puget Sound. The program has considered relevant approaches to
  achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory
  requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create
  jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build
  infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA
  funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2021-2026 : Funding will be continued for
  the three strategic initiative leads (SILs) which will  focus on: Award and manage

  opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial developments and equity investments
  or loans to capitalize a new business or expand an existing business, so the businesses
  can create new, full-time permanent jobs for individuals with low incomes. CED allows
  communities to drive the type of investment and/or business to that which is most
  needed in the community. Seventy-five percent of the jobs created must be filled

  compliance, and other activities authorized by the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of
  2005, Public Law 105-276, and EPA''s annual appropriations acts. Funding Priorities
  - Fiscal Year 2023: Assistance agreements to states under Section 2007 of the Solid
  Waste and Disposal Act will support core program UST activities, implement their
  leak prevention and detection programs, as well as the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPAct)
  leak prevention activities. High priority tasks include providing financial assistance
  to states for the following: 1) adopting and implementing EPA''s recently-released
  regulatory revisions; 2) approving specific technologies to detect leaks from tank
  systems; 3) ensuring that tank owners and operators are complying with notification
  and other requirements; 4) ensuring equipment compatibility; 5) conducting UST inspections;
  6) implementing operator training; 7) prohibiting delivery for non-complying facilities;
  8) seeking state program approval to operate the UST program in lieu of the federal

  (LUST) prevention assistance agreements to states, tribes, or intertribal consortia
  for activities authorized by EPAct will support states with inspections and other
  release prevention and compliance assurance activities for federally regulated UST
  systems, as well as for enforcement activities related to release prevention. A
  main cause of releases is the lack of proper operation and maintenance of UST systems,
  which is why the EPA published revised UST regulations in FY 2015 that address these
  and other important issues. These changes will require subsequent state adoption,
  applicable updates to state regulations, and updates to state program approval.
  For tribes, the LUST prevention assistance agreements will assist with all aspects
  of the tribal programs, e.g., inspection capacity. High priority tasks include providing
  financial assistance to tribes for: 1) inspecting UST facilities to complete the
  three-year inspection requirement; 2) developing inspection capacity for tribes;
  3) enforcement activities related to release prevention; 4) development of leak
  prevention regulations and other program infrastructure; 5) helping tribes develop
  the capacity to administer UST programs, such as providing funding to support training
  for tribal staff and educating owners and operators in Indian country about UST
  requirements. These activities are geared toward bringing all UST systems into compliance
  with release detection and release prevention requirements and minimizing future
  releases. Priority will be given to providing funds to enable the states to meet
  their responsibilities under Title XV, Subtitle B of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

  and Interstate Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plans (ANS Plans): To provide
  funding to States to implement ANS Plans approved by the ANS Task Force, as authorized
  in the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA). The plans
  identify activities needed to eliminate or reduce the risks associated with ANS,
  focusing on feasible, cost-effective management efforts to prevent and control ANS
  infestations in an environmentally sound manner.  Only States with approved ANS
  Plans are eligible for this annual funding. \n\nAquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task
  Force Regional Panels: To provide funding to the ANS Task Force established by the
  NANPCA.  The Task Force implements a program for waters of the United States to
  prevent introduction and dispersal of ANS, monitor, control, and study such species,
  and disseminate related information. Task Force activities include six regional
  panels that engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders to provide balanced advice to
  the Task Force on issues of regional significance. The program helps the panels
  fulfil their responsibilities under the NANPCA including identifying regional priorities,
  coordinating regional activities, providing advice pertinent to regional issues,
  and making recommendations and reporting to the Task Force. \n\nNational Fish Passage
  (NFP): To restore native fish and other aquatic species to self-sustaining levels
  by reconnecting habitat that barriers have fragmented, where such reconnection would
  not result in a net negative ecological effect such as providing increased habitat
  to aquatic nuisance species. Fish passage projects restore unimpeded flows and fish
  movement by removing barriers or providing ways for aquatic species to bypass them.
  The program works on a voluntary basis and provides support to Federal, State, local,
  and tribal agencies, as well as private partners and stakeholders.\n\nNational Fish
  Habitat Partnership (NFHP): To comprehensively address the causes of fish habitat
  decline by working together with partners to maximize the impact of limited funding
  for fish habitat conservation. Under NFHP, Federal, State, Tribal, and privately-raised
  funds are leveraged through regional Fish Habitat Partnerships to address the fish
  habitat challenges. More information about the Fish Habitat Partnerships and their
  partners can be found online at www.fishhabitat.org.\n\nGreat Lakes Fish and Wildlife
  Restoration Act (GLFWRA): To provide assistance to States, Indian Tribes, and other
  interested entities to encourage cooperative conservation, restoration, research,
  and management of the fish and wildlife resources and their habitats in the Great
  Lakes Basin. \n\nSea Lamprey Control (SLC): To work with partners to assess sea
  lamprey abundance in the Great Lakes by monitoring the spring spawning migration
  in tributaries. Population assessments allow the Service to estimate the index of
  adult sea lampreys and evaluate the success of the Sea Lamprey Control Program.\n\nInvasive

  assumed a critical role in health care delivery as technology and improved broadband

  are transforming health care from a service delivered through traditional brick

  Internet access connection directly to the patient\u2019s home or mobile location.
  Despite the numerous benefits of connected care services, patients who cannot afford

  many low-income Americans and veterans, are not realizing the benefits of these
  innovative telehealth technologies. The costs necessary to provide connected care
  services may also limit some health care providers\u2019 ability to treat patients,
  particularly low-income Americans and veterans, with connected care services. To
  address this, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) established the
  Connected Care Pilot Program (Pilot Program) within the Universal Service Fund (USF
  or Fund) to provide funding up to $100 million over three years and to examine how
  the Fund can help support the trend towards connected care services, particularly

  many low-income and veteran patients who are responding to a wide variety of health
  challenges such as public health epidemics, opioid dependency, mental health conditions,
  high-risk pregnancy, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease,
  and heart disease. The Commission also expects that the Pilot Program will provide

  attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that would assure protection
  of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous
  population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in
  and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program''s approved Comprehensive
  Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) is the Action Agenda. The Action Agenda
  for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation''s largest estuary\u2013it
  complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to
  describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound.
  These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal,
  and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA
  is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse
  impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include
  protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental
  watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the
  generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. The Puget Sound
  Protection and Restoration: Tribal Implementation Assistance Program is aimed at
  assisting the Indian Tribes of the greater Puget Sound basin in their efforts to
  carry out work critically needed for Puget Sound protection and restoration. This
  work includes activities identified in, or consistent with, the Action Agenda such
  as efforts called for by established salmon recovery plans in the Puget Sound basin.
  EPA has a trust responsibility to Federally recognized Indian Tribes. EPA also recognizes
  that Federally recognized Indian Tribes in the greater Puget Sound basin have a
  critical role in the protection and restoration of the ecosystem and its resources.

  preparedness plans. These plans are designed to identify the risks, challenges,
  and potential impacts of catastrophic disasters and establish strategies for coordinating
  response efforts across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines to reduce long-term
  vulnerability. \n\nTo enhance the capacity of regions to identify and address gaps
  in planning, training, and exercises related to catastrophic events. Through the
  RCPGP, regions can identify areas where they lack preparedness and allocate resources
  to address those gaps, thereby increasing community resiliency and community readiness.
  Additionally, the program funds exercises and training opportunities that help communities
  practice and improve their response to catastrophic events. \n\nTo improve the readiness
  and resilience of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, communication
  networks, community housing and shelters (one of three RCPGP core capabilities for
  FY 2023), and public health facilities, in the event of a catastrophic incident.
  This includes identifying critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, conducting risk
  assessments, and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. The RCPGP also encourages
  collaboration and coordination to ensure a more comprehensive and integrated approach
  to disaster response. \n\n\nTo increase public awareness and understanding of the
  risks associated with catastrophic events and the importance of preparedness measure

  from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished
  through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a
  project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information

  the applicant''s proposal noting how the demonstration project is different from
  such prior projects and is a true demonstration. The applicant must also explain
  what will be learned from the demonstration. If the project is truly a demonstration

  EPA will work with individual tribes to develop and implement an EPA-Tribal Environmental
  Plan (ETEP), a joint planning document for achieving stronger environmental and

  in policy making and to assume appropriate partial roles in the implementation of

  and amended titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit IHS facilities
  to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to eligible AI/ANs. This authority
  was later extended to tribal facilities.  Congress has also provided authority for
  Indian health care programs and beneficiaries to participate in the Children\u2019s

  is intended to help agricultural producers offset the impacts of natural disasters
  in 2020 and 2021. Congress included emergency funding in the Extending Government
  Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43). ERP\u2019s first
  round of disaster funding provided payments to producers using existing data and
  did not require outreach because producers were automatically enrolled in the program.
  The second phase of ERP is aimed at filling gaps and providing assistance to producers
  who did not participate in or receive payments through the existing risk management
  programs that were leveraged for phase 1 implementation. \n\nPhase 2 of ERP will
  provide assistance to producers who suffered losses due to qualifying natural disasters
  in 2020 and 2021. This program will be revenue based and will require participation
  in a risk management program for the next two crop years. These eligibility criteria
  and risk management linkage requirements create unique needs around outreach and
  technical assistance for this program. Producers will need to supply information
  to FSA that would typically be found on their Schedule F tax forms, and if they
  have not filed a Schedule F, be able to supply acceptable revenue records or create
  the required application data from their own farm records.  Producers will also
  need to identify and enroll in the appropriate risk management program for their
  operation.\n \nThe assistance ERP program participants will need in order to supply
  application information will be unique to their individual operation and tax situation,
  and more technical than the information we typically provide as part of general
  outreach and program education. As a result, the communication, technical support,
  and outreach strategies around ERP for producers need to be focused, targeted and
  technical in nature. This program also offers the opportunity to connect with producers
  who have not worked with their local FSA office, and an opportunity to not only
  participate in ERP but also serve as a gateway to risk management tools and other
  FSA and USDA programs and services. FSA has $8 million available for cooperative
  agreements to provide outreach and technical assistance for the Emergency Relief
  Program Phase 2. \n\nThe Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with stakeholder organizations
  to effectively reach producers, including those that are small, underserved, and
  not currently participating in existing programs who did not apply under phase 1
  of the ERP program.  FSA is seeking proposals from eligible entities that focus
  on outreach for increasing awareness about ERP and have the primary goal of connecting
  landowners interested in program participation to apply under a traditional FSA
  application process. \n\nExpeditated outreach by stakeholders should include:\n\u2022\tTechnical

  Year 2023: The Clean School Bus Program works to reduce pollution emitted from existing
  school buses by replacing them with low and zero-emission school buses. Priority
  will be given to projects which propose to replace buses that serve high-need local
  education agencies; rural school districts; Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded school
  districts; and school districts receiving basic support payments for children who
  reside on Indian land. Further priority will be given to applicants that leverage
  additional external funds to support project activities. In addition, evaluation
  points may be given to projects which result in outcomes that benefit affected communities,
  those that engage local communities with respect to the design and performance of
  the project, those that serve Ozone or PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance areas,
  those that demonstrate that project results and benefits are sustainable and can
  be continued after project completion, and those that demonstrate a plan to prepare
  the workforce for the project. For FY2023, projects will be funded under the 2023
  CSB Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity.","popularName":"Clean School Bus Program"},{"cfda":"32.011","title":"Affordable

  and facilitating the transition to next-generation technologies through sector-based
  restrictions on HFCs. For more information on the AIM Act and its implementing regulations,
  please visit https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction.  \n\nThe objectives of
  these grants are to support and contribute to addressing HFCs under the AIM Act
  by funding three project areas: (1) Reclaim Technologies - pilot projects or proofs
  of concept for new/better technologies to increase the reclamation of HFCs by expanding
  access to reclamation and improving the reclamation process; (2) Reclaim Market
  Dynamics - programs or pilot projects for innovative strategies that address market
  dynamics to increase HFC reclamation by lowering barriers; and (3) Innovative Destruction
  Technologies - pilot projects/proof of concept for innovative technologies or innovative
  deployment of technologies to destroy unusable and unwanted HFCs. \n\nSuccessful
  implementation of these funds by grantees will result in the advancement of improved
  technologies and/or deployment of technologies for HFC reclamation and destruction
  and identification of successful mechanisms to address barriers to HFC reclamation.  In
  addition, successful projects will thoughtfully engage with, provide benefits to,
  and mitigate any potential negative impacts to low income and disadvantaged communities
