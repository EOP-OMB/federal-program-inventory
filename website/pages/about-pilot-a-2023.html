      <p>
        In 2023, building upon the successful 2020 exploratory pilot effort and recommendations published in
        the 2021 Report to Congress, OMB launched Pilot A, which focused on federal financial assistance.
        Pilot A seeks to answer the following questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Can the infrastructure (systems, policy, people, processes) that support the assistance listings
          (ALs) on SAM.gov serve as a basis for the structure of the inventory for federal financial
          assistance programs?
        </li>
        <li>
          To what extent does the current AL repository provide a template and infrastructure for the
          implementation of a larger inventory?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we come to a common understanding of “program” that can connect information about
          spending, performance, and results?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Why focus on financial assistance and assistance listings?</h2>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        2 CFR 200.203 identifies the Federal Assistance Listings (ALs) as "the single, authoritative,
        governmentwide comprehensive source of Federal financial assistance program information produced by
        the executive branch of the Federal Government." Housed in the System for Award Management public
        website (SAM.gov) run by the General Services Administration (GSA), ALs provide a detailed picture of
        financial assistance programs for use by potential applicants and to provide transparency to the
        general public about Federal resources. Each program must be identified by title and its authorizing
        statute, and be assigned an identifying number (AL Number).
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past several years, financial assistance has routinely accounted for over $3 trillion of
        spending and constitutes a high proportion of Federal programs. Additionally, ALs are tied to agency
        financial data through DATA Act reporting and to performance data through the requirement for
        agencies to report accomplishments within them. By starting with assistance listings, OMB can
        build a pilot FPI website that accounts for a significant portion of all federal programs.

    <h2>Initial insights</h2>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        Pilot A attempts to answer the following question: Can the infrastructure (systems, policy, people,
        processes) that support the assistance listings (ALs) on SAM.gov serve as a basis for the structure
        of the inventory for federal financial assistance programs?
      </p>
      <p>
        While analysis and stakeholder engagement are ongoing, below are initial insights from the pilot thus
        far:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Definition of program:</strong> While assistance listings are "the single, authoritative,
          governmentwide comprehensive source of Federal financial assistance program information"
          (2 CFR 200.203), there are still instances where they do not align with other authoritative lists
          of "programs" (e.g., programs identified and tracked as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).
          OMB should continue to work with Agencies to ensure that assistance listings consistently represent
          programs and that other authoritative sources of federal assistance programs align with assistance
          listings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Categories:</strong> The 2020 exploratory pilot found the use of categories to be helpful
          both for collecting information on programs and for understanding and analyzing program data. While
          Agencies currently assign programs to mission-based categories during the creation of an assistance
          listing, there is little to no instruction as to what these categories represent or how they will
          be used. The current assistance listing template has three separate questions that ask agencies to
          identify the program's intended use/function/subject from pre-defined lists. OMB has an
          opportunity to work with Congress and Agencies to update and streamline these lists and to provide
          additional information on how these categories will be used so that Agencies can ensure correct
          program alignment. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data standardization:</strong> The data fields used for the assistance listings do not
          necessarily match other government systems such as USAspending.gov and Grants.gov. OMB should
          evaluate and update the fields Agencies are required to fill out for assistance listings based on a
          comprehensive understanding of the information needed across systems reporting program data. For
          example, "eligible applicant type" as reported in the assistance listings does not line up with
          "recipient type" used in systems such as USAspending.gov.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> A central goal of the FPI is to better link spending and performance
          data across programs and agencies. Currently, agencies are instructed to include information about
          program performance measures in the "Objective" section. To meaningfully leverage program
          performance data, the collection of that data should be standardized within the AL template.   
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Governance:</strong> The process for creating, updating, reviewing, and clearing assistance
          listings needs to be clarified and streamlined. Agencies should assign an accountable agency
          official to oversee the quality and consistency of assistance listings. Additionally, OMB and GSA
          should collaborate to develop workflows that would facilitate the review and clearance of numerous
          assistance listings by these officials and OMB staff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>System:</strong> While the assistance listings data can serve as the basis for the federal
          financial assistance portion of the FPI, SAM.gov was not built for the type of comparison and
          analysis that the FPI website should enable. Most of the insights listed above suggest
          modifications to the processes or data collection hosted on SAM.gov. Currently, the General
          Services Administration, which hosts SAM.gov is not resourced to make these modifications.
