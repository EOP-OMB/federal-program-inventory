        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a single website that provides a “coherent picture of all Federal programs, and the performance of the Federal Government as well as individual agencies”. The scope and magnitude of such an effort has proven challenging and efforts to overcome those challenges have been met with varying degrees of success. Learning from those efforts, in December 2020 OMB launched an exploratory pilot as the next step towards creating a coherent and comprehensive inventory. This site provides the history of the Federal government’s efforts to create an inventory as well as key insights, data from the pilot, and planned next steps.
