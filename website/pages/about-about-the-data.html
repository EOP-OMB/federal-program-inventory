        This website leverages publicly accessible assistance listings (AL) data from SAM.gov and financial
        data from USAspending.gov, linked to assistance listings through the AL number. The functions and
        subfunctions used to categorize the programs can be found in the Annual Publication of Assistance
        Listings Functional Index. Agencies submit data for their programs directly to these sources.

    <h2>Explanation of terms and concepts</h2>
    <h3>Assistance Listing</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        Assistance listings are detailed public descriptions of Federal programs that provide Federal
        financial assistance such as grants, loans, scholarships, insurance, and other types of assistance
        awards. Every assistance award must be aligned to an assistance listing, and every assistance listing
        must be authorized by congressional statute. 2 CFR 200.203 identifies the Federal Assistance Listings
        (ALs) as "the single, authoritative, governmentwide comprehensive source of Federal financial
        assistance program information produced by the executive branch of the Federal Government."
      </p>
      <p>
        Assistance Listings are created and maintained by the administering agency on SAM.gov and must be
        updated annually.  
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Assistance type</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        Agencies identify the form in which the Federal government provides assistance to the award
        recipient, including contracts, grants, loans, insurance, and direct payment. An assistance listing
        may provide different types of assistance.

    <h3>Category (sub-category)</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        For the purposes of this pilot, categories and sub-categories are the functions and sub-functions
        that can be found in the Functional Index in the Annual Publication of Assistance Listings on SAM.gov
        (catalogue editions available for download here). When creating Assistance Listings for each of their
        programs, agencies are offered the opportunity to select one or many functions and sub-functions that
        best align with the program from a pre-defined list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In selecting from the list of "functions" and "sub-functions" agencies are not offered guidance on
        their meaning. As a result, the number and context of "functions" and "sub-functions" assigned to a
        program may vary by program. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Data source: SAM.gov (note that the function and sub-function(s) are not displayed on the assistance
        listing. They can be found only in the Annual Publication of Assistance Listings.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Eligible applicant type</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        Agencies identify entities that are eligible to apply for each program when creating the assistance
        listing. The main purpose of this is to inform potential applicants of the programs for which they
        can apply. Information on award recipients can be found at USAspending.gov.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional specifics about eligible applicants for each program can be found on the program's
        assistance listing on SAM.gov

      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Eligible beneficiary</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        Agencies specify who may receive the ultimate benefits from the program. Programs that provide
        direct assistance from a Federal agency will generally have the same applicant and beneficiary. In
        cases where assistance is provided through State and local governments, the applicants and
        beneficiaries may be different since the assistance is transmitted to private sector beneficiaries
        who do not have to request or apply for the benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional specifics about eligible beneficiaries for each program can be found on the program's
        assistance listing on SAM.gov.

    <h3>Obligation</h3>
    <div class="usa-prose">
      <p>
        When awarding funding, the U.S. government enters a binding agreement called an obligation. The
        government promises to spend the money, either immediately or in the future. An agency incurs an
        obligation, for example, when it places an order, signs a contract, awards a grant, purchases a
        service, or takes other actions that require it to make a payment. Additional detail is provided in
        OMB Circular A-11. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Obligation information sourced from SAM.gov is provided by the administering agency for each
        assistance listing via the table below.

      </p>
      <p>
        Each year, agencies report actual obligations for the past fiscal year and estimated obligations for
        the current and budget fiscal years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Obligation information sourced from USAspending.gov is provided by agencies in accordance with the
        2014 DATA Act, which requires reporting on a quarterly and/or monthly basis. For the purposes of this
        pilot, program obligations from USAspending.gov are calculated by taking the total of obligations
        aligned to the assistance listing at the transaction level for the fiscal year.
