        The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), as amended by the
        William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA), requires
        the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a single website that provides a "coherent
        picture of all Federal programs, and the performance of the Federal Government as well as individual
        agencies." This picture - known as the Federal Program Inventory - would allow policymakers and the
        public to review and analyze Federal spending that shares a common purpose within and across
        agencies. An appropriately constructed inventory could also improve financial and program management
        through the establishment of stronger connections between spending and performance information,
        reduce reporting burden, and ensure Congress and OMB are better prepared to nimbly respond to
        emerging priorities.

          The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) is signed into law.
          GPRAMA directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure the effective operation of a
          single website that provides a "coherent picture of all Federal programs, and the performance of
          the Federal Government as well as individual agencies." This coherent picture becomes known as a
          Federal Program Inventory (FPI).

        <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading text-base-dark">January 2012</h4>
        <p>
          OMB performs a pilot (M-12-07) with 11 agencies as part of an iterative approach to implement
          the GPRAMA requirements.

      <li class="usa-process-list__item">
        <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading text-base-dark">July 2012</h4>
        <p>
          OMB issues guidance (A-11, 280.3) based on lessons learned from the pilot to develop an initial
          FPI. The guidance recognizes that agencies and their stakeholders use the term "program" in
          different ways across widely varying missions and gives significant latitude to agencies in how
          they define programs.

        <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading text-base-dark">May 2013</h4>
        <p>
          OMB publishes an initial FPI that includes more than 1,500 programs from 24 agencies. Because of
          the flexibility provided to agencies in how to define programs, it is difficult to use the
          inventory to make meaningful comparisons across programs.

        <p>
          The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) is signed into law, directing OMB to
          establish government-wide data standards for certain financial data and improve the quality of
          the data reported on USASpending.gov. Meeting the DATA Act reporting requirements becomes the
          focal point for OMB in creating the FPI.

        <p>
          GAO makes several recommendations to improve the 2013 FPI including using a more
          data-centric approach to provide a more coherent picture of all Federal programs and better
          ensure information is useful for decision-makers.

        <p>
          OMB focuses agency efforts on implementing the DATA Act. This important work to improve data
          quality (M-18-16) and build a more robust data information architecture are prerequisites to
          creating a coherent and comprehensive FPI.

        <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading text-base-dark">Early 2020</h4>
        <p>
          As agency DATA Act reporting matures, OMB uses lessons learned from that implementation and the
          lessons learned from the initial GPRAMA FPI pilot to re-imagine ways to create the program
          inventory and identify advancing FPI efforts as a 2020 priority.

          OMB issues a memo to Federal agencies launching the FPI Exploratory Pilot as the next interim
          step to creating a comprehensive inventory. The pilot is designed to identify gaps in existing
          guidance and test an innovative approach to defining programs.
